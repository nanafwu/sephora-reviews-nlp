you have a sephora store nearby
i wore it twice a week as was recommended by my helper at sephora
received this is my playbox this month
i've had a secret yearning for this product for a while
bought this product on recommendation by a sephora in-store specialist
spent money on this
thought it agreed with me
it's been breakout city
by the end of the day it smelled horrible like old spf
as others have described
my friend actually used this
i wish i had spent my hundred dollars on something else
this product was strongly recommended to me during my makeover
an associate in the store was talking this product up
the girl in sephora told me to store this in my fridge
great eye cream for a 15-18 year old to use
ed it over to my teen daughter
i actually bought this
the customer was wearing a lot of makeup
i recently purchased this product
wrinkles formed where i never had them before
so advice from an elder for you younger glams
i received this product as a gift from sephora
it hasn't done anything for mine.
since i like to wear foundation
this is the first expensive ageing product that i reluctantly purchased
i originally wanted to try the 2 in 1 retinol night cream from this line
since sephora stopped carrying bliss micro magic
the product is described as having 'super fine' grains
the lady at sephora told me this was "one of her favorites
the fact that every employee raved over it
they got notified of the packaging problem
was recommended this product
i've bought countless tubs of it over the years for myself
she has never had acne
i followed the directions religiously
this one is a dud
was completely grossed out by the texture
i am an athlete
i liked the original
sadly this mask delivered none of that
my boyfriend hated it also.
i received this product in my sephora playbox.
i almost suffocated when i apply this
sadly, i had to return it.
neither replaces the lost
the sephora rep said it codve been the ginger.
my skin recently has bee very clear
this has never happened
i would have purchased
this would have been a solid four star rating if it hadn't been for the price
i tried out two milk products
that i had to pass this one on to a friend
i finally purchased it
the reviews said it worked
finally purchased it yesterday
i loved this moisturizer when i first purchased
i wish it worked :(
after talking to the sales associate for a very long time
it was recommended for me from a lady in sephora
i stopped buying it.
i spoke with a sephora employee about this product
when i redeemed beauty insider points
"smells amazing" is how i've seen it described in almost every shop that i found it
i loved this cleanser initially
i'd been using a different oil from a specialty grocer
i tried their old formulas
the one that the discontinued
their old formula cleanser was the only thing that finally worked for my skin after trying so many different products
after using the old formula
the old cleanser never gave me any problems
i liked this initially.
i took this with me on a recent vacation to a tropical location
this oil burned when i applied it.
tried this one because i enjoyed a moisturizer from this br
i gave it to my mom and she enjoyed it a lot.
bought this last year
changing form of birth control gave me a bit of acne that i've have not dealt with previously
apparently customers have told the person advising me that they've broken out once they stopped using this
i am a licensed cosmetologist
a worker recommended it to me
i would purchase it if it was drugstore
i am living for it
i initially loved this product because of its smell
i understood that it was just that
i intended to leave it plugged in to the outlet in the bathroom
i recently purchased this product
even won an award
i gave it to my mom
i might recommend this to a friend
a sephora employee directed me to this
hated that it was in a pot
my face felt firm
i desperately wanted this to work in place of my beloved nude omega oil that has been discontinued
now i'm that crazy old lady begging nude to bring back the original oil
i enjoyed using it
bought this thinking it would help
after researching i found that this water pack is not noncomedonic
with that being said
unfortunately not sold by sephora
i found that it performed well as a primer
the color that they sent me "05 in the buff
this product changed my mind
bought this as a lift
firm cream as it's called
like i said previously
had never in my life suffered from acne
the shimmer it left behind reminds me of the girls i went to elementary school with
this cream served no function.
as was the case with me
now they have disappeared
that being said i had 2 problems with this.
ordered this based off of the bestseller recommendation by sephora online
was recommended this at the store
i've previously tried this serum through numerous samples
in store before purchasing
like other drunk elephant products
i am a 33 year old female.
i assumed this product was a moisturizer because of the name
i am living in the south
i just reordered it
loved the old formula!
tried my new jar today
if i had never tried the old formula
i miss the old formula!!
bring back the old formula!!!
this has been my holy grail moisturizer for the last 2 or 3 years
this product is a bust for me
the girl at sephora said i was doing it properly
the sephora employee told me to buy it
this has officially ruined my impression of korres as a company
that was probably 20 years old at that time
i spent $100 on a bottle of 1
have been diligently applying it ever since
i used this bottle faithfully
i suspect the reward points i used to purchase might have been an old deluxe sample
reminds me of an old lady.
as others have reported
i smelled like old gr
it smells like old lady
since the bottle is glass
as recommended by an employee
so this was recommended to me
gave it to my teen daughter who loved it
in that sense, the eye cream met my expectations.
it worked fine though
it maintained my skin
since it is water based
a sephora skin-care employee recommended this to me
a sephora worker suggested this product to me.
i quit using it
it was recommended to me for brightening
i recieved this as a 100 point perk
fan of the old formula of clarins' multi-active day cream
i recently changed primers
i went to buy a new jar
i moved to florida recently
just hasn't worked for me.
the associate told him the tube was discontinued
this was recommended to me by the sales associate as a very moisturizering
i received this as a reward.
traded in 300 points for 3 of these- 2 for me one for my sister who was excited to try it
this product was recommended to me by a worker
i liked it when i had it
have worked for me
the sales associate told me she swore by this at night
my friend also tried it out for 30 days
particularly their commercial in china which works to remove the stigma from being an unmarried woman with a career
i assumed the smell would at least dessipate
the pro consultant doing my makeover said this would be amazing
was referred this by a sephora consultant
with the recommendation of a sales associate i decided to try this out
trying this at the store?
the sales rep was so convincing
when i ceased using this product the feeling of "chemical peel" disappeared
i tried this product at the recommendation of the kate sommerville rep who was in town at the local sephora demoing the products
i tried it in store
recently purchased this because i am 20 something
i tried it under my foundation
this girl was less than helpful to me
i tried this based on a sales associates recommendation
the downfall to it is
it was more firm after applying
it has not worked for me as a primer
as others have noted
i wore it under my makeup
was a disaster if applied after
i've recently moved to socal for college
spent $42 on this product
any time i've purchased a product that a smaller yt'er/blogger has raved about
then i went shopping in a mall
saw this product recommended by a youtuber
unfortunately it made it oiler
this is the only skin care i changed since the perricone rep sold it to me
this was recommended to me
i gave the product to my mom
this was my first product that i've ever tried from drunk elephant
had a makeup artist try this on me during a makeover
i enjoyed using this
have noticed that the nude color was sold out time
this was a bust for me.
if money grew on trees
this was a success for me
loved it for a while
as a result it has invited even more dirt
a sephora worker pushed me into buying this
my sister and i both used and our skin broke out.
gave it to my mom
i am a 28 year old woman with normal-combo skin
the sales clerk told me that it would be as a primer also
was in a dream with this product
the lady at the store told me this would be perfect for me
i look at the bottle with regrets
had been eyeing their stuff for a while
i didn't notice at 1st my niece did
that's what lured me into buying this product.
not bought the bottle
at least the rice enzyme powder in classic is still my friend
bought this one on a whim
i watched a youtuber use and recommend it.
it worked for like a week
my skin is recovering
i assumed i got a faulty one
was recommended this one
especially since it's been recommended to me repeatedly
bought because i love origins masks
my friend and i used it at the same time.
the title says it all.
with that being said
take care of a newborn during the day
bought my regular miracle worker that i love
scooping it out was quite a novelty
the packaging sold me on this.
am in my mid twenties
i am a five-lush-products-at-once kinda girl.
after discontinuing my favorite skin care i have been searching for a replacement
on days i wore makeup
i mostly associate the br
lancôme with department store perfume counters in my mind
like boys high school gym locker
cheap old man cologne
was lured by the great price point
i recently picked up a new bottle
i tried this product on a whim
i already returned it.
the sales lady at sephora really sold me this product
i loved the glow under the foundation when i initially applied it
when i initially applied the product
recently purchased it as it was recommended to me
it worked well overnight.
made me believe this was a life saver
it gave me more regrets than my high school relationship
it was recommended for me
especially since my skin had been acting up
it worked wonders for my skin in just one week
boy i wanted to love this
i received this in my playbox .
see that fragrance has been added
i wanted to purchase it
with the old version
it worked so well on dark spots
if you're looking to put aide a brightening mask
the black mask was sold out in store
i would recommend this for people with aged skin.
i just recently re purchased
it was short lived
my title says it all.
the saleswoman recommended this product.
twice a day as the lady at sephora recommended
on with acne since being a teen
i enjoyed applying the mask.
i knew that this contained sulfur
i tried this on the recommendation of a sales associate after i told her i wanted a face cleanser that also truly removed makeup
bought this because it had all five star reviews
it was new to the store
someone at the store suggested it
on since the spring 2017 vib sale
blamed my make up
this cleanser was the only new product introduced into my regimen
i tried and i regret.
i loved the way it smelled and applied.
my mom actually bought this
my life style has changed in the past month
been called "a hidden holy grail"
knew i hated it
i tried this product in store
when i tested in the store, it was fine.
i've had mine for 6 months now.
the sales lady spoke highly of the br
disappeared throughout the day
i can name a few that have worked
i received an email about receiving a two week supply aptly named the two week challenge with a $25 dollar purchase
trying to find the perfect under eye cream i was sold
bought this when sephora had it in as one of their new products
the girl working there said i should try this she raved about it
bought it tried it
bought what i originally was wanting
because who has time to sleep?
i picked this from rewards bazaar.
have moved on to other products
it reminds me of the smell of an ill very old person
mild acne after being recommended by my coworker
i initially wanted to purchase the tiger grass treatment
bought this after using the cremadin cream
it still has not worked for me
which i wish i had realized years ago
worked well as a 'natural' foundation with the added bonus of spf
i wore this with no makeup
purchased this product because i have rosacia
my 14 year old son is using it now
i loved this when i tried it at the store.
bought this because i have rosacea
if you want to reminisce the smell of the last time you visited a petting zoo this might be for you
i worked in esthetics for a long time
i imagined how light
i looked up the name "nilotica" which confirmed my suspicions
my eyes ached while i slept when i used it
bought two packages to give it a chance
still searching for a replacement from my face lotion that was discontinued
i looked like the matchmaker in mulan.
my go to lines have been origins
ole henriksen for the last 2 years
almost fainted from the perfume
i've never been a fan of bar soaps
when i received this product in the mail from influenster
i saw that it was sold by sephora
it was a bar of soap.
i received this from influenster
i revived it in a free trial from influenster
gave it to my mom
the in store demo sold me
if you've ever been around a metalworking shop
what was stated in the description
have been experimenting with it
i got one for my daughter and she loves it!!
unless you are a 5 year old girl
my 9 year old daughter said it looked like i had been crafting
in the lighting i was initially under
i received a total glitter bomb
my boyfriend comments that i look like a little girl who just left claires
not before/after the gym as described
with that being said
according to the description it said that after 4 weeks people saw differences
i recently received this product for free from influenster
i received this as a feee gift from influenster.
had a lot of success with it
the evening to see which worked better
i am 55 years old and have combination skin.
this ione didn't work for me i 40 years old
a sephora worker recommended this product.
wished it would've work.
i've recently started to notice some fine lines here
for someone who is my age
he said it smells like gas station bathroom soap
i wish it would have worked since i love the smell
and my mascara traveled because of that.
but had the formula changed??
i switched to this based on the recommendation of a sephora cast member
bought both the charcoal
he told me he would rather use drug store bar soap on his face
my sister did use it
i ordered the online
41 years old with realistic expectations
especially since i spent $150 on it
noticed it is clarins' new line launched about 6 months ago
bought specifically to wear under makeup
this was recommended to me by someone working in sephora
i assumed it was the acne medicine i was on
the woman that helped me raved about this moisturizer
after a few weeks of using it i find that it's not as amazing as the woman described it to be
i explained to her that my skin was changing i assumed due to aging
this only served to make my skin greasy
as noted by others
i sadly had to return this to sephora!
sought help for sephora employees
that my friends has been a game changer for me
just a nurse who is a product lover.
all my died skin will be gone
spoke to someone about this
a worker from sephora recommended this to me
bought this on a whim on one of my layover.
recently moved to a drier climate
bought it as vib after receiving the email
initially i loved this cream!
a friend of mine uses this product
worked for my friend but not for me.
was suggested this product by employee after using the kiosk
which is what attracted me to this product
a friend asked me to buy some for her
also it smells like an old lady.
i've tried the original creme
this is not the original cream that inspired the cult following
i received this product from influenster.
the product built up
assumed it was a primer
i wanted this product for months!
the lady who recommended this to me got my hopes up
wanted to love it because i had bought he toner as well
i've suffered from acne since 10
i kind of bought this on a whim
this one is supposedly loaded with aha's
that is a pet peeve of mine.
felt like any old moisturizer to me.
my old moisturizer got discontinued
i received this product
it wore well under makeup
this was recommended to me by a store employee
i am missing my clarins eye cream a lot since purchasing this
purchased this to try on my smile lines
then i told my sister to feel my face
sadly i returned this product
i regret buying it
this worked well for the first 2-4 weeks.
bought this oil because of all the hype.
it was a different story
my coworker had the same problem
my husband loves it and i gave it to him.
the fragrance was all gone
with that being said
i wish it could have worked for me
the product did not work for me as described
i regret purchasing it.
worked for my sister who has combo skin
it left my 60 year old mom's skin super smooth.
need something for 49 year old skin
my friend told me about this
i received this as a gift
is known as an "instagram" br
bought it soon as it was in stock.
i saw her use it as a primer in one of her insta videos
i also saw that it was always sold out on the farsali website
i switched back to my old cleanser
i lusted after this product for a long time before finally caving
i disliked this product
it has not worked for me
the old formula was perfect: lightweight
had to return my new bottle
recently origins replaced it with this
you can imagine my shock when i discovered that they had changed the formula
the old formula was light
i used the old formula of this product
my son kissed me on the cheek
the old one was light
glad i only bought one.
please bring the old formulation back.
i been using the youth sorbet every single day since i was 17
thats how amazing the old formula was
it's not as light weight as the old one which was a dream for me
i used the old sorbet version daily
it was given to me as a gift from my gr
i wish this would have worked out
so did my teen daughter
purchased as a replacement for a discontinued moisturizer
loved this product when i tried it in store.
i ordered this with expedited shipping last thursday
now that my shipment has been delayed
rescheduled 4 maybe 5 times as the product sits in a warehouse somewhere
firm lover masks to see what the hype was all about
the sephora workers were raving about it
also hated the smell.
reintroduced it back on my skin
my makeup had separated
i would never recommend this to a friend.
this product has been sold out everywhere
i love her older products as well
sadly this serum broke me out badly
it was suggested to me at my local store
which is a pet peeve of mine
let me start by saying i am an avid drunk elephant fan
i've used all of the drunk elephant products
sephora for the drunk elephant line
bought the whole regimen
i faithfully used the product morning
love several drunk elephant products
however the eye serum has not met my expectations
when i first bought this
this helped my skin
have already had problems with leaking
it leaked all over my medicine cabinet
a 22 year old with combination skin
she is just now discovering/loving de
this is one of the first drunk elephant products that i'm not 100% in love with
this one is a dud
i really wished i had saved my money
that it was travel friendly
i ordered this online
can do something interesting with the same old same old
it was on backorder
i've heard people who love this
it was sold out
it was sold out
i saw it in stock in my local store
leave this for the teenagers
this has been a staple
after i discontinued use
had this product recommended by a friend who works as an esthetician
it has since been discontinued
i'll be returning to my product from origins.
because it's done wonders for a friend
old, but she's actually 34 yrs.
i gave it to my husband and he loves it.
initially i loved the smell
i passed it along to my mom who loves it.
i think this has replaced some
i recently bought this from their brand website.
bought this after attending a sephora class
it made my foundation
when i was inside sephora i also smelled their tester/ sampler
it smelled the same
i received this product as part of a 7 day trial
he said it smells like old lady
with a name like that
i've repurchased them a few times now
getting a $7 spot treatment that worked wonders
applied it in the car
it was a waste of my money .
i should have done more snooping before i wasted $60 on this because once i snooped
i even contacted them about it
sephora launched this product on 8 august
i've seen how this company works
they lost a very loyal customer
sadly the girl recommended it
i am 50 years old
it was recommended by a sales associate
i realized that it stopped working
realized that since its in a jar
after years of using philosophy purity with my clarisonic
haven't yet reaped the benefits
the reason why the the sales lady recommended it to me was to help with my dark spots
i wish this moisturizer worked for me
i recently tried again
although when i this was recommended to me i immediately purchased it
i must say it worked wonders.
i redeemed a jar with my points
decided to treat myself to this as an early birthday present
my skin became irritated
i compared the old bottle vs
discovered the formula is very different
i think mine turned
i tried two bottles
bought this cream to use at night time after applying my olehenriksen night transformation gel
as it was recommended by a sephora employee
i tried this moisturizer as a suggestion from one of the sephora staff
i got this based on a recommendation from an employee
i ended up returning it because it was an expensive paperweight
on i only used it once before my skin rebelled
this product was a dud
with the romance of how this product is created
i didnt break out but my sister did
thank god i only purchased the travel size one.
a family friend tried the product
she described the same scent
opted for the original
i would not recommend this to a friend.
i accidentally bought this instead of the renewed hope in a jar
bought renewed hope in a jar
i accidentally ordered this after trying s sample of the renewed hope moisturizer
gave the rest to my niece
decided to use it recently
boy was i wrong!
i always bought the 2oz
accidentally purchased the 4oz online
my friend strongly recommended me this moisturizer
i recently purchased a new jar
received this as a gift
a few years ago i stumbled upon a retinol from philosophy that did wonders for my acne
it hasn't worked wonders like the other product had
plus i had previously been on a different retinol
i wish i had discontinued use earlier
bought on recommendation from sephora associate
i've never been a girl that had sensitive skin or had issues with any product
a sefora worker recommend this tried this religiously morning
i splurged on this after it was used on me in a custom makeover
based upon her recommendation
one of the sephora associates recommended this product to me
it traveled into my eyes
bought this for the winter months
they renamed it to premieres vendanges
i chose this because i was out of moisturizer
decided on this one with the help of a store employee
i loved the travel size i had.
caudalie changed the formula of this
i loved the product before it changed formulas.
the product smelled like old oil
this was the recommendation
bought this product based on staff recommendation
thought it was pink eye
i used this cleanser faithfully for 7 years
never had any complaints
i miss the old product
they recently changed the formula
i took the sales associates word for it
this product is nothing like the old product.
i loved the old version of this product.
it also smelled like an expired product.
bought a ren cleanser instead
returned my product to the store
was in love with the old formula
i loved the old caudalie cleansing milk
this last purchase i noticed they changed the formula
brought couple products from this br
i spoke with a sales associate
the sales girls told me to use this
that worked very well
bought this product to replace the origins spot treatment
the girl in sephora told me this was all natural
with that being said
this product came highly recommended when i said that my concerns were about my black bags
so purchased the product
i'd been using dior hyrdalife for years
the girl at sephora recommended this.
worked for a little while
bought this to use as a night cream
the sleeping facial in wild rose worked great for me
i did keep one to give to my niece for christmas as she has oily skin
my 15 year old daughter seems to like it
it also worked fine for my skin
gave it to my mom.
it is fine initially
i wish i could have returned mine
i gave it to my mom
purchased a replacement for him
this stuff saved me.
this is the first time i've disliked a murad product
like the previous poster mentioned
my cousin swear by it.
it has done wonders for her complexion.
i am someone who has been struggling to find something to help my large pores since i was a teenager
as recommended by the sephora employee
for me, this one hasn't helped.
it never worked for me
they recently switched to a new packaging
a half of using it religiously morning
the dermadoctor rep recommended this
bought this for my mom because she has severe rosacea
face have been a concern of mine for years
i started using this moisturizer because a dermadoctor rep was at sephora that day
sales associate insisted product would be ideal for me??
i used it faithfully for 2 months for my redness.
bought a $40 piece of dried clay
because i spent $40 on it
my daughter used it in the shower
at 42 years old, i still have acne prone skin.
i actually bought mine several years ago
loved it when i had the sample for my birthday.
this is my nightmare
my sister has it
recently i ran out
i grew some bumps
worked at a coffee shop
my skin is recovered now
i wish this had worked out for me
bugged my allergies to no end
i will give to a friend
my wife loves it
i got this as the birthday gift
i received this as my birthday gift
33 oz for my birthday gift
i received this as well as the matching moisturizer as a free birthday gift
i wish it worked out for me
after research i've learned that sqalane
except in my wallet
i received this as my vib birthday gift right in time to resurrect my dull
i got the little birthday gift kit that included this serum
this is not your friend
something i've never experienced with another cleanser
my bf's sister gave me a tester she took from work
the sales assistant who convinced me to buy this br
he also said that he had been a smoker for the past 20 years
clarins representative made me buy this one
i splurged and bought a bottle six weeks ago.
for my nearly 40 year old eyes this is a "so so' eye cream
i wish it had worked
i gave mine to a friend.
i invested in a tube
mother kept for decoration in her bathroom
i used this balm many years ago, and loved it.
this worked as a cleanser
the older i get
if i was younger
i liked how this worked on my skin
it was a splurge before
it also happened to my friend that i gave this too
this product was recommended to me by a sephora associate
if i had spent $10 on a product
i returned this junk!
the smell everyone talks about
the old bottle was nice
formerly it was exactly perfect
it has been returned
smells like old lady
there was a staff who said they were a murad rep/expert
as most people are not cursed with death valley for a face
i did some hiking
in my case it was a waist of money
purchased this out of recommendation
worked well for the first bottle
a friend of mine let me try this for a couple of weeks
it has really saved my skin
he is only 23 years old
i would have bought the night version
which has helped my skin
i've bought a different brand now that i love.
gave it to my boyfriend
live in the northeast
i later found out she was a dermadoctor representative
the woman mentioned that the tester was probably just old
as opposed to the 3-4 months the rep stated
at my last sephora store visit
when i told the associate what happened
i took her recommendation
a sephora associate raved about this eye balm
a sales rep swore to me that she used this product personally
a sales associate recommended this eye cream after i told her that my primary concerns are dark circles
if i lived closer to sephora
bought it after the demo at the store
ad bags because i have 1 year old that hates sleep
i splurged on this because the representative at sephora promised it would work
when i was younger
my eye bags have been paying for it
asked a representative to help me
" "it worked on me
as this was the first product i ever really splurged on
the girl told me that i'd have "instant" results
heard wonders about it
the sales woman said it would take about 12 mos
my mother was interested
buy my mom a new one
figured it was worth it if it worked as it stated
i tried this mask many times with my sister
i remember i first bought this when i lived in europe
it was recommended by sephora staff.
however my sister did not
i am 72 years old
was coerced into buying by a pushy salesperson who swore results
which my aesthetician told me she uses on her ageless-looking skin
but having ordered it, i tried it.
when i returned it the sales associate said "it's too strong for you
the first time i ever purchased this product it felt like it worked miracles
i really disliked this product and returned it.
not the wonder cream described
a sephora employee geared me towards this prof
i trusted her advice
had asked for help from one of the sephora employees
she had recommended this
i would have to reapply
this moisturizer was described as soothing however it sat on my skin
the sales lady vouched for this cream as the best natural
a lady at sephora recommended i try this because i was also buying a korres face wash
my skin was a nightmare!!!!
i visited sephora store in perimeter mall
two ladies told me to buy this moisturizer
i told them my experience before with this item
i bough it last month
she told me to get it
i got this as a gift for my birthday--my mom knows i was curious because all of youtube was abuzz about it
after a friend confirmed that
after a consultation with the sephora sales associate
my mom told me to start using eye cream
was told to return it to sephora
maybe mine is expired or something
the sales clerk suggested it to me.
the smell was something i'd never associate with a skin product
i got this for a 54 yr old man.
it has been a month since purchase
he tried this lotion for men a couple of times
made me look older
did it firm my eye?
everyone i know has been asking me if i've just woken up since using this product
i brought for my brother
my mom originally bought this for herself
my boyfriend's sister recommended this cream to me
my mother on the other hand swears by it.
i am 31 years old
so i was told to buy this product.
i loved how it applied
my son likes it.
i got this for my boyfriend
got this for my husband.
got this for my fiance as a gift.
bought this for my man, he didn't like it.
it has no smell initially
hearing close relatives rave about this product
switched back to my old moisturizer
purchased this product because of the hype
a friend gave this to me in the past
i received this item as both part of a birthday perk trio
my friend loves it
i recently purchased the 1 oz size at a gr
opening of our neighboring remodeled sephora store
sadly i gave it away to a friend...
worked well with my makeup
not even in my teen years
while in the store i chatted with a sales rep in the store
it still became filmy
i got this for my bf since he has enjoyed the face wash
i recently noticed that this product has gotten the least amount of use
i recently purchased this at my local sephora
for some strange reason unbeknownst to me i stopped using it
i loved that it already had spf in it
the pump stopped working
this product was recommended to me by one of their sales rep
the girl gave me a weeks worth of samples
also had an spf
as an 18 year old girl
the employees of the store could have processed my order in store on friday
the sales assistant reassured me
my trust in shop assistants
i liked the packing and pump bottle.
i believe i should've bought one of the other ones
bought something from another br
gave it to my sister
it worked very well for her
giving all the product to my sister now
but it's been discontinued.
i received this as a gift
i wish this worked for me
the woman suggested this expensive primer
they denied any formula change.
bought one for her
it is nothing like i have sampled in stores or the ones my mom has gotten in the past
i won't even gift the unused one to my mom
bought it on a rep's recommendation.
reminds me of a medicine cabinet
i recently found another primer
although i am young
loved other korres wild rose products
only to find it was an under-performer
i wore this moisturizer so excitedly hoping my skin would benefit from it
the girl who always does it said she had never seen my pored this clogged
since it has spf
i loved it at the store
my daughter who is 16 likes it
spent a month trying to convince myself
my sister had told me to buy the oil
i accidentally purchased this
i immediately regretted this purchase
i went to the store with the intention of buying the balm
my regular face wash was sold out
this is what she recommended
bought this makeup remover by accident
mothers perfume was in there
i am 40 yrs old.
it was out of stock, so i ordered this one.
when i found out they discontinued it
i tried this version
that moisturizer has been discontinued
i told myself to be patient
according to people it has worked
i gave it to my mom.
i wish this would have worked for me
i switched to a different br
this was her suggestion
i got this product because it was recommended by the sales girl that did my mini-facial at sephora
it was also recommended to by sephora's associate
initially i liked this cleanser.
they changed the formula
recently switched to this one because of the brightening formula
the lady at the shiseido counter convinced me that i'd love it
my sister tried it
it was recommended to me by a makeup artist on a job i did recently
also the dark circles i have obtained with age
would have been a good value if it worked for me
i am only 20 years old this ruined my under eye area i am so upset
been using it since april
i returned it and bought the clay which i love.
they probably sold the company
i tried this product because the sales associate recommended it
thought this one has actually worked
it planted bombs in mine
bought this as i felt my skin was changing
it was suggested by a sephora employee
a rep from this company used this product on me in store before a makeover
so the sephora lady recommended this for me
this was recommended by one of the employees
a ren representative was there
she laughed at me saying the alcohol was non-drying
she told me this eye cream is light
a sales girl talked me into this product.
been using this product for 1 month after a sephora store associate recommended it to reduce puffiness
i've had to return the product twice because the pump was defective
after 1-2 uses the pump quits working.
this was recommended to me by a representative at sephora
couldn't tell if it smelled awful because i was sold an old tube
please go back to the old packaging !!
has been an absolute nightmare
go back to the old packaging.
go back to the old packaging please!
the old is 7 oz.
the cleanser itself has worked wonders for my skin
there is also an ounce less product than the old bottle
they should have just raised the cost of the old packaging
bring back the old packaging please!!!
the ridiculous pump top has flown off the straw
in my case it burned my skin
this product was recommended to me by a store clerk
i ordered this product online
since i have adult acne
i recently tried ptr rose wash
since i loved the cleanser
it's been an absoulte nightmare.
worse now in my 30s than when i was a teen
this was recommended to help
i tried this serum because i have been having a breakout or two lately
i adored the old formula
the cleanser itself was gold man
i used mine about 2x a week
why this formula was changed
which my sister uses
i gave it to a friend with normal skin
even when the 1st bottle worked
a sephora staff member recommended it
i tried this at the recommendation of a store associate
i originally bought it to help clear blemishes
this product worked wonders for my acne prone
i've had a recent obsession with fresh products
so when asking one of sephora's associates for advice
the friend who recommended it to me has had success
i initially had combination skin
initially i thought it was working
i gave it to my sister who has really oily skin
the lady from clinique told me it removes makeup
made me look old
returned it to the store
i brought this home so that my teenage daughters would have a goto at time of "pimple alerts"
according to the bottle i have
it was a waste of my money.
i regret spending my money on this.
bottle i received this in the mail.
that combination has worked wonders on my skin
t seems to have worked for some
this product was recommend to me by the sales associate at sephora
perhaps my skin is getting old
wish this worked out for me
i sadly had to return
to compare i am a 44 year old
saw recommendation in prevention
it worked miracles for my face
never changed my mind
i tried this after someone recommended it to me
have tried everything in the book
teen son used this treatment along with the cleanser
i've repurchased this several times
i asked the sales girl about it
she talked me into this and raved about it.
everything i have purchased is amazing this is the only disappointment that i have had
it has not worked
while i have not been formally diagnosed with rosacea
having trusted clinique products for years
i've never been diagnosed with rosacea
happily dished out the $45
i started using it at first 3 years ago when i first diagnosed with type i rosacea
this product was recommended to me by a dior rep
i ordered it from sephora
it instantly smelled like it expired over a year ago
i got this because my coworker swears by this.
kind of like old honey
i mentioned that to associate at sephora while inquiring about a mask to help with acne scars
a close friend of mine did say my skin was looking better
i returned the turbo booster
bought this on the recommendation of a sephora associate 6 weeks ago
which i've had since i was a child
none of which have ever worked
the sephora associate practically promised me that this cream was like nothing i'd ever used
which the associate assured me of also
i live on a 40 acre lot
i milk the cows every morning
i definitely recommend this to my friend who lives next door
she owns a cabbage farm
when i first bought this eye cream
i visited a sephora store to find an eye cream specifically for my dark circles
this product was recommended to me
just recently i agreed to splurge on this item
it worked for many people
had re-purchased this product twice thinking it was an amazing moisturizer
accidentally ordered this since they looks very alike
i gave it away to a friend who wanted it.
replacing it with my old moisturizer i notified that i was breaking out
with no known allergies
re checked the label
i loved the way this felt on my skin initially.
my mother and i spent over $400 each.
loved the way it worked with my claisonic.
tried this product on a recommendation from a sephora clerk
for the money spent
none lived up to the hype.
my problem is gone
this has not worked for me
have enjoyed his book
my mom bought this
she is in her 50's
i also had red
i spent almost $100 on this eye therapy
after 3 uses it had a burning sensation
had to return it to the sephora store
it was recommended by a sales agent
the store consultant told me that i was maybe overwashing my skin with products that contained salicylic acid
as a result just made my skin look old
returned it to the store
this item was part of it
this was recommended to me by a sephora employee
tried as a suggestion from a sephora consultant
i told her all my products
i took it back today and repurchased purity.
which i originally loved
she recommended this one
no one wants to smell like an old lady except maybe an old lady
this was recommended to me by sephora staff after the moisturizer i'd used for over a year suddenly waged a war on my face
i tried this as the sephora sales associate raved about it
since korres has been discontinued
was persuaded to try this product
since it's double the price of my old moisturizer
i wish i had returned it
especially after the sales associate went on
it has made my h
i got this as a gift
i wouldn't recommend this to a friend
after receiving it as gift from a girlfriend that is a youtube addict
and my friend says the same thing.
received this as a gift from my sister
this mask worked miracles for his skin
quickly regretted the decision
which has never happened
it works like a dream
bought this during the summer time
was hoping it worked as nice as my drugstore br
that i had been playing around with
loved the older version
the cap has leaked on me a bit already.
6/7 bottles i have purchased
this has been the case
was recommended by one of the employees to use this because when you have dehydrated skin
then passed it to my less dry sister who loved it
one i received as a gift from my mom
the money i spent on it gone
i found that i wanted it to work
helpful store associate recommended this
if i hadn't thrown out my receipt
this year i decided to fork over the money
was assured by the staff member at sephora that this was a light
something has changed in this
i just purchased another jar
worked for their company for atleast 6
i disliked this product and returned it.
i swore by this cream.
they since changed the formula
one of the clinique sales representative at the counter told me she has the same problem with this product
the past two jars i have bought have been grainy
having worked for clinique- they are a great company
they changed the formula on this product- loved it before
the pump stopped working
i cannot walk around with this old lady smell
more recently been using it religiously hoping to rid my under-eye horridness
it worked for like 2 hrs
this product was recommended to me by the worker at sephora
over the summer i had purchased this moisturizer
i let a friend try it
it was recommended for me by a sephora store attendant
someone at sephora recommended this to me.
i wanted to try it because i have developed bags
this is the first skin care product that i have splurged on
this was recommended to me
i recently purchased this product
i just bought my 2nd bottle.
i'd buy this by the truckload
i tried it as directed
the regiment i was using along with this product was good
i repurchased this last week
boy was i wrong.
it was a different story
gave it to my mom who also hated it
i told her i wanted something lightweight
the sales lady urged me to purchase this
was at local sephora to purchase clarins when kate sommerville rep pushed this product on me
not an agent civilian clothes
i gave it to my mother
that i had to buy it
a boy was the one who pointed this out to me
returned to the old br
i learned from this experience to never buy this br
it performed no better
this was part of the skin care regime a ks consultant prescribed for me
i recently purchased the exfolikate cleanser
recently i decided to care for my acne prone skin
it agreed with my skin
i've had acne since i was 9 years old.
the lady at sephora recommended it to me
i noticed that it had started to smell like mothballs after a month
i've owned this product for a year now
i've had acne for 25 years
have tried every drugstore product out there
i've had acne issues since i was a teenager
this goat milk hasn't helped at all
it worked well throughout the fall months
my 47 year old mom uses it
given the goat milk
so frustrated that you ruined a product that worked perfectly previously
the girl talked me into this product
i just compared my old box to the new one
am battling my old acne all over again
i've loved this for a long time
the sales associate recommended this product
i smelled this one in the store
she swayed me over to do the old
i am 42 years old with a good, even complexion.
they suggested this br
this is a product i splurged on.
i used it faithfully
i regret this purchase
inspected the before/after
while the associate at sephora was helpful with this product she told me you had to try it for at least a month
the sales person sold this to me
she told me it would take 4
nowhere was this described as being an oil.
they had represented there
was buying my normal cleanser when the sales rep pulled me to this product said it was amazing
the fact that we recently moved
purchased this product about a month ago
most regretted purchase i've ever made.
asked what it was
a sephora consultant recommend this for me.
i could use the old fashion
at the recommendation of the sephora salesperson
this product was my introduction to murad.
putted this mask on
this winter was the worse i have experienced since i was a kid
i am 35 years old
i used as described.
basically looks like you bought it at the dollar store
bought for teenage skin with real black head problems based on the description
i returned this after religiously using for 3 weeks
i am almost done with the bottle
this product was recommend by a sales associate at sephora
the stopper stopped working
told by my 30 something dermatologist to get this
now my boyfriend uses it also.
i got this product because it was recommended to me by the skin specialist to treat my dark circles
i just turned 45 years old
i returned for a refund
i should have bought another bottle
decided that even if it worked wonders
a sephora employee recommended using this said it amazing
:/ was i this blotchy looking earlier?
with that being said
my self esteem plummeted
will stick to old st
has not produced the effects it described.
they have transformed my skin!
i wasn't sure if it was an old sample that i had neglected
i actually loved the way this product worked
the price is unrealistic for this working girl
i gave it to my friend who doesn't mind the smell
was this the original intention?
a little nauseating… like something died on the ocean
as i began applying i understood what everyone was talking about
as others have noted
especially for those living in the east coast
my friend liked it though.
i will go back to my old eye cream which worked way better
i loved how it was absorbed
decided to use a mini of this recently
having a child of my own that dealt with reflux problems
even my boyfriend tried it
it worked great for about a month
i agree with people who recalled this as a basic cleanser
i never had dark circles
originally i got it for my dark circles
originally meant to get the eye duty triple remedy
i told the girl at the store i wanted something to help with my dry eyes
i became accustomed to it
a sephora sales girl recommended this to me as a face moisturizer
bought this to use a night cream.
i just bought this today
this one is a dud
luckily only bought the pods
while this worked ok as just a moisturizer in general
the title says it all.
it was recommended by a sephora employee specifically for my redness
the sephora employee i consulted claimed this one
girl at sephora recamended this and....no.
have to get that confirmed).
it just hasn't worked for me
this product has been ok
i've decided to make an appointment for a dermatologist instead
use it religiously every morning
i originally wanted the $12
i tried this after my favorite mattifier was discontinued
i paid for this
when i got the jar i thought it was overpriced
jar is ill represented in photo
the damage was done
i am 57 years old.
congratulated for its sampling policy
i wish i had returned.
wanted to try something directed at acne
wish it would have worked
lesson learned this was not me.
this product has ruined my skin.
has raved about it for years
i initially thought it was a purge
bought this with high expectations
i made my sister give it a try for a couple weeks
1/3 of the product leaked out of the container during shipment
despite having a printout of my online order showing it was charged to my credit card
first aid beauty has a lot
had tried their cleanser to relative success
i initially bought it because while getting a makeover at sephora it seemed to work great with my skin
needless to say i gave this moisturizer away to a friend that loved it
i actually traded this product in for the boscia eye puffer
i don't think it worked well for de-puffing
this is the 2nd time i've bought this
i felt that it didn't really deputy my eyes in the morning
i told another associate
a sephora employee recommended this product to me
i orginally got this as a sample from an order
the dior rep happened to be at the store
this was recommended to me in the store
my sister gave this to me.
was originally going to give it to a friend
my sister bought this for me as part of a kit.
i gave it to my sister to try
while this product worked fine as an eye cream
never found the smell
i realized it was the cream
this product was recommended to me by a sephora employee
i got a sample of this eye cream at my local sephora after speaking to an associate
i searched sephora for the eye cream i needed
my baby even smelled it
i suspect it is the cream
this was recommended to me
according to the sales girl at sephora
after recently switching to the perricone line
i decided to soldier on because of perricone's reputation
i spent the entire day with a mayor migrane
this was a gift to a friend.
applied the cream it had the scent of fish which we were unaware of
i prayed no one would notice.
as it was recommended to me by a skin care consultant
bought on a whim because i loved the packaging.
the woman working at sephora recommended this to me
it has been winter
the sales woman thought this would be a gentle enough br
the lady recommended that i get something with scylic acid in it
up-sold to this product
person who told me to purchase this said it would help with my acne
retired it to the back of the vanity
was suggested this by an associate
mouth than i have ever had
i wish i had returned it
it hasn't touched the acne that i have
i also miss the frankincense in the old version
never a problem with the former version
was suggested to me by a sephora employee.
note that this product has been now repackaged as an am/pm moisturizer
i wish i had returned it
i tried it on my father
sister after they showered
the lady who sold it to me said it was natural
i decided to give this umpteen tries
my friend used it too
it was sold out everywhere
i regret purchasing it.
i even had my sister try it
my teenage daughter's and i did it together.
i recently purchased this mask
my friend also tried it
she had the same experience
would have loved it at a sleepover
the woman at sephora suggested this to me.
i regret buying this.
this product was suggested to me by a sales associate
bought this creme instead
wish it had worked.
so i gave it to a friend of mine.
i learned my lesson
since i work outdoors
splurged on this about 4 months ago
my mom raved about this cream.
i feel like mine lasts about 3-4 hours before i have to reapply
i asked the beautician at sephora to recommend some high quality products that would work on my face
the odor disappeared after awhile
she tried it out in store with a bb consultant
watched it work its magic
i wanted to buy it
i almost believed them
considering this cream was almost 60$ cad
annoyed that now i have to go pay to have these professionally removed
i got this after a friend told me it worked really well
received this as a requested gift
especially because i saw it on sale at an outlet mall
i received this as a gift
recently started to use this morning
i would recommend to a friend.
my foundation looked freshly applied after about 8 hours
unless it was a miracle worker
the product worked well as a base for my makeup
previous review about smelling like a hippie is dead on
i am middle aged
i developed them under my eye area
i wish i never bought it.
wish i saved that $20
i wish i had just stayed with bb's original hydrating eye cream
with the help from an amazing sales associate
just bought this for my mother for mother's day
after the girl at the store told me how wonderful it was
just bought instant firm face tightener
i almost freaked out in the store
it was like a film attached to my skin
i've used the lashes to die
the white film remained
got the birthday samples
i got a sample of this as recommended by the sephora employee as my birthday gift
i first used this when i got my free birthday gift
initially it worked really well
i got this in the birthday gift set with the serum
was happy to see it was the birthday gift this year
the moisturizer for the birthday gift
when i first received this for my birthday gift
wish it worked for my skin
i received this as part of my birthday gift.
you know, like the expired-product smell?
i received this in my playbox
the salesperson swore it would change my life
when the bodyguard got discontinued
it was the first dermadoctor product that i have disliked
from the sales associate at the store
i wish it worked for me
i wished this would have worked for me it has a wonderful concept
i splurged on this product because it sounded intriguing
i initially bought the product because it sounded great
it sounded like a miracle product
i wish it would of worked better
the sells lady at sephora recommended this
none of the ones i had previously tried ever truly worked
since the store only had one jar i also ordered a jar online
made the mistake of buying this one
which was a surprise because shiseido's benefiance intensive eye contour cream worked wonders for me
i immediately loved it
after a month of use i felt that it wasn't working specially for moisturizer
every one working at the store asked if it was for mymom
although i am 25 years old.
back to the drawing board for this mom/teacher.
this product was recommended to me by a sephora associate
my lines disappeared again thank god
it worked wonders on my sink
it also worked well under foundation
also a zit had formed
my eyes burned and teared i can not use it.
was told by sales associate that this eye cream was for dry mature skin
what i initially loved about it
the girl told me that i have great skin
i received this in my playbox
i give props to the sephora associate who tried to convince me to buy this product
it sorta might have worked
when that bottle was done
the name escapes me
as the former product does
my first purchase had a whiter
spoke with a sephora beauty advisor
take it from someone who has spent at least thous
subsequently, i returne it for a refund.
needless to say it has been returned..
it laid on my skin
then i looked like a prepubescent teen again
because they were sold out of the overnight repair cream
the manager at the store recommended the philophy one
i am 63 years old
my esthetician questioned me as to what products i had used when she saw the condition of my face
bought it at urging of salesperson
i overheard them talking about how exciting it was that they actually sold one
this smelled so strongly
also felt oiler than the one without spf
the saleswoman told me i should use the new moisturizer with the spf
would defiantly re purchase this
it also smelled bad
twice with high hopes because my sister loves it
by in my drawer
bought this for my mother
i've tried repeatedly to find the secret to a residue-free application
this was a gift for my husb
got this product with the 21st birthday kit.
as others have noted
all the magic disappeared
told me to wash my face
i recently purchased a refill
it worked for a bit
i blame living in the city
i miss the old one!
my sister said she experienced the same thing.
was directed to this one
because the one i wanted had been discontinued
missing the old product :
bought this when my local store was out of my favorite caudelie makeup removing cleansing oil
like it had not been cleaned well
was directed to this by a salesperson
i repurchased this oil 3 times now
never achieved the 'rich milk' described- it never lathered
the lady at sephora suggested this.
i still tasted sharpies all day
i wasn't repulsed by the ingredient list
a sales associate got me to try this
the clerk recommended it
i watched a segment on a show with the benefit girls
my old eye cream on the other
it burned like fire
bought this product in august
i returned it and won't be repurchasing.
i recently tried this product.
ever since i was a kid
thankfully i hired a make-up artist to do my make-up
the sales associate at sephora raved about this product
this is one of the few products from the line that i haven't been wowed by
i am 22 years old
ill be returning this
i am guilty of that as well
those benefits were short lived
i wished i had returned this
i liked it at the store
the ladies there kept on recommending it
i forgot how ineffective it was
specially when the sephora's sale associate recommended it for me
bought it for 57 can $
haven't touched it since
boy does it sting
my beloved clarins eye cream with spf 30 has been pulled from canadian stores pending testing/approval of the sun protection claims
the lady at sephora raved about it
was talked into trying this cream
neither cream helped in that department
if they work as claimed
it also migrated into my contact lenses.
ineffective product i have ever bought
it actually aged my eyes.
ineffective product i have ever bought
the sephora saleswoman recommended this
it was a waste of my money
ineffective product i have ever bought
i got some samples of the original perricone olive oil moisturizer line a few years ago
one of the assistants at sephora recommended this
purchased this product along with the eye cream
a friend and i both bought to fade dark spots.
i used it faithfully morning
i checked in with the friend
she had the same experience
i got this product after a sales associate at a sephora store raved about it
if they sent a 1 oz bottle
when i hadn't had a pimple since high school
which i did not previously have
$32 for half an ounce?
i am middle aged
i wish i could have bought the samples
it smells like an expired product
bought this with high hopes.
i wrongly assumed this was pure as well.
my friend gave me this as my birthday gift
my boyfriend was totally bothered when i slept with this mask on
my friend had the same problem where it stung
i gave it to a friend
i saw an ad for it and bought it.
has been suffering from acne
since i'm still in college
it's been a staple product for me for ages
this cleansing water worked
also had an alcohol scent to it
one the consultants told me to use the dermaclear to help remove lipsticks i've tried on
it worked good for removing makeup
this product worked well
off during my adult years
it has microglitter in it
the area under my eyes where this had been applied looked very shiny
bought one in a skin care kit
my cousin suggested this product to me
the woman at sephora recommended it
when i received the bottle
go buy tea tree oil for $4.00 and thank me later.
would not rebuy or recommend to a friend.
saying that this was her holy grail
however, i was lured by the "anti-aging" siren.
i've contemplated returning it because the scent
loved the original formula.
i got this as part of an origins kit.
my sister has dry skin
this was recommended to me
it was recommended to me by sales staff
i already had reservations about it
initially it stung a bit when i applied it
my friend also used it
and i decided to splurge on this.
this mask has never worked well for me
i never this problem with my previous product.
i initially chose this to wear under my concealer
loved this for years so when i developed burning
i neglect this area of my face
i found that it burned my eyes
it increased the amount of acne i had originally had
after a friend recommended it
my face is oiler than before
the novelty soon wore off
grew into disdain for this product
tried this under recommendation of friends
the sephora woman told me to get this product
that worked better for me
it made me oiler throughout the day
sephora recently stopped selling the moisturizer i was using
i spot treated it
my skin has been acting up recently
personal recommendation by a staff member at sephora
im glad they have recently repackaged it because that was my #1 complaint
as others have noted
this was good on my ski
this product is described as 1oz
bought this is in a rush since i had dinner reservations
the associate showed me to the touch screen tablet thing
she asked my skin type
kept having regrets when using it.
i spoke with a skin care expert in sephora
who after explaining to her my skin problems
she recommended this product
she told me this would help since it is a gel
age defying.....age defying?
i regret buying it
the clerk at the store talked me into buying this one
this was recommended to me
inhave tried everything from drug store br
no difference in my 37 year old skin
the newer version that has been around the last 2 years is terrible
i loved the old formulation of turnaround concentrate
wish that i'd spent the money on a trip to my dermatologist instead
the sephora associate suggested this for me
i accidentally bought the intense version
a salesperson insisted this is what kept her skin youthful
it was never aggravated by a product like this
this product worked great the first month or so.
i even went so far as to have my photographer husb
this one is a dud
i fall under the 35-44 age group
i tried this in the store
this worked for a week
worked well under make-up
i gave it to my roommate to use who has severe acne
purchased in store because they were out of the mask
i've never experienced this before in my life
would return it if i lived closer to a sephora store
asked her what she have done to her face
she said she started using this cream
i even bought the algenist oil, nothing.
my mother both got one of these
it was different for my mother than it was for me
this eye gel was given to me as a gift from a dear friend back in december
it also gravitated into my contact lenses
wish it had worked for me as well as it's worked for a lot of the reviewers
after 2 jars of this product, i am done.
a saphora consultant suggested i try this product
i am a woman on a mission.
it has been working well with that
have been enticed by korres products in general
it made my skin oiler.
this was so fake
that i paid for
this was the first product i've ever had to return in my years of being a sephora junkie
it was recommended by a sales lady
i sadly had to return.
if i had bought it during the winter
that's where the beauty consultant tried it in me
that even if the product worked
when it was working
was a smoker for a decade
i am 26 years old
i wanted badly to believe the salesperson at sephora who claimed this was one of the best products out there
this product was recommended by the sales person
smells like fish that died a natural death.
this cream had a fake
truth revealed with spf15 for ages
the salesperson talked me into this one
saved myself some time
was immediately repulsed by the smell
the smell before buying
i just bought this by mistake
the sales person suggested it
i wish this would have worked out...
i actually bought it for my husb
had heard about this
it is not a miracle worker
i recently bought this product after sephora stopped selling the skyn eye cream
received this as a gift
splurged on this eye cream
i erroneously thought i had “acne” because i always had some kind of pimple on my face
i changed my face
it was short lived
as it was in my case
this was a purchase i regret most.
the ingrediants ate natural.
since i already was
that was the claim.
it had the feel of old fashioned beach sunblock.
loved it for months
cult products years ago
i then purchased "good genes"
he remarked that my crow's feet
i gave it three stars because a friend of mine who also has this product says she loves it
i slept with it
gave the product away to a friend
it reminds me of a horse barn
i've never suffered from acne
back to my old faithful.....
received this in my playbox.
it was an acquired taste
i found this moisturizer inadvertently on sephora website
plus mine kinda had a dead fish smell...
mistakenly thinking that it was the same like philosophy "help me"
i must have patted
the omega had results in one day.
the girl at sephora convinced me to buy this product instead
i applied as directed
sales person sold it to me as a spot treatment.
although i wished this could have worked out
had already gotten the moisturizer
i brought this product for my boyfriend
over the years i have struggled with acne.
i've had adult acne since 2005
loved loved loved old version of this.
dismissed the reviews that said this was not as good as the old formula
i used the original 'instant' moisturizer religiously a few years ago
i tried out this product after it was confirmed that the source of my acne was my skin's dryness
leaving for a visit with friends
remembered i had bought this mask
it did firm the skin
was recommend this product by a sephora rep
told a rep what i had been using
have been using this every night since dec
the fact that i've been using this since dec
it reminds me of a drugstore brand.
my tzone has been on the oily side already this summer
as i chose it based on another customer saying it "smelled divine"
for reference, i am a caudalie loyalist.
hunting for a body oil
thought i'd hit the jackpot
i just bought one for my face and hair.
old-school bath-oil pearl
i received this product in a sephora gift pack.
my friend tried as well
having been made with oatmeal
i personally like overnight masks
was recommended this by an associate at sephora
was recommended to use this at sephora
they sell in china
the vinosource riche was replaced with this.
vinosource riche was my staple for years
product is expensive and has not worked for me.
the worker persuaded me to buy this clinique one instead
my mom got this for me a while ago
assumed it wasn't working
it did moisturize my underage area well
i got this originally for my dark circles.
this product did an amazing job at concealing
i deduced that it was this product
is in every magazine
i compared it to what i had left of my old bottle
to melt into my face as the store associate had promised it would
i followed this product's instructions to the letter
i swapped it out for nixoderm
my aunt gave this to me.
bought this after seeing all the 5 star reviews
this isn't a miracle worker
the sephora consultant guided me to a representative from the dr
this was recommended by a lot of people
the sales lady recommended this br
it worked for my friend and she loved it.
most regretted purchase i've ever made.
i regret listening to her
nothing has ever worked
it was sold out during the vib sale
it was a piece of junk.
i've bought two bottles of this product previously over time that i loved
this was the first ptr product i've purchased.
patiently answering all my questions
i inherited it pretty quickly
then i noticed that korres had been acquired by johnson
it has completely disappeared
purchasing an origins eye cream that was recommended to me
worked just as well
still i was blinded for hours
asked the associate to recommend an eye cream for under eye darkness
so she discontinued use
she likes the results
i enjoyed that it has a pump.
this product ruined it
got this moisturizer recently
i ordered during winter
i loved that it had no sent
the pump stopped working
i just destroyed it
i initially loved the hydration
my sister even called me to see if i was having these issues because her new supply was the same way
true old formulations back?
talking to sephora staff in the store
i got talked into buying this.
ordered it with hope
just hasn't worked for me.
since i've raised two kids
been a nurse most of my life
my face was devastated with breakouts
sensation that others have spoken about
the formula had possibly been changed
since the company was sold it has been changed.
i am bummed as i have bought at least 30 of these since it launched
i loved the way this made my skin initially
a sales associate recommended this
my friend purchased this as a gift for me becuase i have been wanting to try it it for so long
the salesperson recommended it
i got this as a gift
it seems has worked for others
the reputation that this product has
i regret buying this
loved it after one use
if you don't care for an old rose smell
i recently received this product as part of a promotion
i gave it to my mother to use
she found the consistency
after researching the company
i originally bought this for my mom
my mom uses this one
the sales rep had told me that i don't need
this came highly recommended by a friend with puffy eyes from new baby lack of sleep
the verdict is in
sales person told me to get this instead
bought what i originally went in for
i paid $200 for my last eye cream
thought it was a bargain
i each purchased this eye cream
this worked ok for me
s have worked better for spot treatment
must've forgotten that at time of purchase.
this worked well for me
i returned this and bought more nightamins.
i received this as a gift
i initially noticed the smell
i loved the old formula
have been searching for years for my fix
ruined my foundation application
it worked upon application
i wish that anthony's product worked just like it was advertised
in lieu of revisiting my teen years i decided it was time to give it up
i liked how this worked to control oil
had my colleagues also smell it she said the same thing
even my husband said that my skin was glowing!
i originally liked the feel of it
i am 35 years old
this product made the teen youth of acne come out all over my face
i gave it to my friend
i originally bought this as a day
this was recommended to me by sephora employee
was drawn to this product's claims
i wish it would have worked
my boyfriend even commented
i left it unused for about 2 weeks to finish the other eye cream i previously owned
i just bought this
then i fought i was allergic to something in my hotel room
i am only newly 29
it's dried out my underage area
or i am tricked into thinking it does
a sales woman at the store recommended this to help with my under-eye bags
none of them have worked for me
got this product for my acne scars that i've had for years
maybe because my scars were old
with that being said
used it for a year -- no results on red acne scars / new + old
glad it worked for other people
will continue to treat old scars
i tried this product on a recommendation of a staff member
bought this for my mother.
the sales lady recommended this product for me
i only bought this yesterday
a sales associate recommended this
it hasn't been for me
the product was suggested by a sephora employee to improve my skin
initially i thought it was my bb cream
even more so than when i worked nightshift
i used it faithfully
i think this is just a scam.
got this product on the recommendation of an associate
i found it worked better at night
i am going to be 30 years old
've kept buying it
i brought this with me for my summer vacation to southern china where the temperature was around 30-34c
battled with adult acne
it worked to reduce dark circles
i loved my first container
so much i repurchased it
about a month ago i reorganized my beauty products into a drawer
my mom said the last pimple
bump on her face was when she was a young girl
have been using the older version "repairwear intensive eye cream" for years
bring back the old version
had an allergic reaction within days of using
bought algenist eye cream after returning this.
made me look older
with that being said
have friends that work at the stores
it has transferred from my face to my hair so when i use it
i tried this in store
initially it worked well
it had an alcoholic smell to it
i just wished they sold more packets in this product
initially when i applied this product over my face it was really lightweight
in the beginning it worked well
tried this out after a salesperson recommended it
even during my teenage years when all my friends were battling acne
have liked or loved a majority of their products
radiance since i'm getting married in a few months
" so said the sephora associate
i found that my mother has purchased this product just recently
i originally wanted to use it as my main moisturizer
leave this at the store!
a sales associate recommended the product
bc the sales associate suggested it
tried this as a replacement
nothing has worked with this foam.
the sales associate talked me into purchasing this one in it's place
i regret listening to her
my daughter gave me this for christmas
recently tried this product.
wish i knew that this was a self tanner when i got the sample
used this without realizing this was a self tanner
nearly had a heart attack
i wish it worked!
then at dinner with friends
my cousin is a dermatologist
thought i'd use this on special occasions
i told the sephora sales associate about it
glad i had gift cards to purchase this.
the emperor has no clothes, as they say.
i gave it to my mom and she loved it.
it worked well with my skin
smells like old milk going on
i wish it worked because i love the smell.
this product was recommended to me in store by sephora employee when i was searching for a new face regime because i'd felt that my previous one could be improved
the product worked well
this oil really only served as a fragrance oil for me
i live in the north so my skin has been a bit flaky
i researched face oils extensively
tried it on my hand in store and loved it!
when i ordered online
so she advised me to try photo plasma
spoke with a woman who recommended this product i explained i have rather dry skin
the sell woman told me a serum was not necessary.
the photo plasma is getting returned.
my sister who's in her 30s and swears by it.
i am 37 years old.
bought this with my 20 per.
bought this 3 months ago
although i have outgrown most of my acne
since i started to use this product i saw my skin older than before
retained this throughout the day
so the first "firm
i then purchased the cleanser
after 4 days of using this newly-gotten moisturizer
i wish it had worked
bought this because of the glowing
it smells something like a gas station
recently bought this cleanser on a whim because i heard such great things about this br
it worked fine but i couldn't stand the scent.
i got this cleanser because it was recommended to me
it was the first cleanser i ever purchased that cost more than $20
i will give it to a friend to test
the pump stomped working
the pump wasn't working
bought it when they were doing a demo.
half for the name
initially i thought i loved this stuff because of the herbal smell
since it has no chemicals in it
my aesthetician suggested this as a replacement
this was recommended to me by one of the girls at sephora
tried this in store
bought the new product
we've all known them
or worked with them
she did some of her homework
she studied a little bit for finals
people who have dark circles
i remembered how much i've loved other origins products
i ordered this cleanser because it claimed to do everything i had ever hoped for
so this product was recommended to me by a store associate
the sales lady recommended this for me
i wish this worked for me :/
it's claim of anti aging is far fetched.
blemishes disappeared immediately after discontinued use
i tried it at a local sephora.
my skin became irritated with it
i feel i have aged 5 years in one month!
for the price i was actually praying
would reconsider purchasing in summer months
the staff told me it was ok to use near the eyes
i noticed recently that i've been getting black heads in that area
weekly masks since like forever
it started to make my face itchy recently
i really splurged on this item
bought this in korea years ago
bough this 1 month ago
it has done absolutely nothing for my underage area
i feel i have aged 5 years in one month!
at first this product worked very well
have been using this product religiously
despite religiously wearing the eye
i feel i have aged 5 years in one month!
this product saved face.
my acne disappeared very quickly!!
was loyal to it for years
was told by multiple people that this would work wonders for me
now i have to repair what's been damaged
i contacted sephora about my situation
i've since found another br
title says it all.
this product was recommended to me by a worker that said it would definitely remove my eyeliner
after the packaging/formula update about a year ago
t lived on the shelf for a while
my mom has used this for years
i'll probably give it away to a friend
at the suggestion of an employee
i switched when i realised i was looking 10 years older
my face is looking my age
wish i had never bought this.
i wish it worked out
has worked very well for me in the past
i used this product last when i was 10 years old.
as others have claimed
i applied some to my boyfriend
bought a new supply this summer.
it is the first one i have ever bought-
i got this as a gift
i also asked my co-worker who tried it
the lady swore by this
i should of smelled this product before applying it
a worker told me this one was better for younger skin
the this moisturizer is the only thing i've tried on recently
i tried this product because it was recommended to me by a sephora representative
i religiously mask each week
purchased this product last year
found that it hasn't
it was partly the reason i returned it
my skin was a wreck
this was the first balm cleanser i ever purchased
as it is advertised
i felt kind of cheated
now the reaction has cleared since i stopped this serum
i hoped that meant it was working
this product made me look 5 years old as the day progressed
was attracted by the spf
maybe it was just mine?
it was in my wishlist
which hadn't been a regular problem
selected the version that specifically noted that addressed old acne scars
i am 24 years old, normal skin, never break out.
i asked store associate about smaller bottle
i started using this product daily about six months ago after asking a trusted sephora associate what she recommended for evening skin tone
i am 50 years old
i am 45 yrs old in surgical menopause.
the murad cleansing cream was recommended by an associate
i tried this cleanser at a friends house
a sephora rep recommended this cleanser because i was breaking out
knew i had to discard of it
the feeling was short lived
not wowed by this after a few uses
got this product with my free birthday gift.
the rep talked me into this at the vib event.
it came highly recommended by the ba at the store
i tried wearing foundation
she said it "transformed" her own skin.
i learned my lesson
passed this along to a friend
bought this when a brand rep was in the store.
she swore it was a holy grail product.
boy was i wrong
it worked amazingly on my mom
mine was very watery
so i gave it to a friend.
on my last visit a representative from kate somerville was in sephora
a sephora staff member recommended this
i returned it for a refund.
which has never been my issue
the gal who sold me in it said it was the best product for dark spots
a problem i hadn't for 25 years
a different sales associate spoke down to me as if was my fault for buying a cream that wasn't meant for "young skin
i don't know if the product was old
i steered away from the pump moisturizer that i had been using
wish is would've worked out for me
i used it faithfully morning
i spoke to two different skin specialists
this was because of the people i spoke to
a sephora employee recommended it to me
i loved the way it applied
was recommended by sephora employee.
i started using drug store moisturizer about a year ago
reminded me of my grandmothers rose perfume.
the former was amazing.
a sephora employee recommended it to me
switched back to my old oil cleanser
almost like i had an allergic reaction.
but the smell is like something died.
so while this worked on those areas
had it worked well i would tolerate it
despite religiously wearing the eye
i feel i have aged 5 years in one month!
bought this product on the advice of a sephora associate
i searched for months for a good replacement
sadly, i had to return it.
this product came highly recommended to me by a sales associate
received a deluxe sample; wouldn't buy it.
after this moisturizer had been on my face
bought this to add to my algenist arsenal
gave it to a friend to try
was recommended by a woman at sephora
the girls at the store suggested this product
was purchased because origins black mask
bought it to try it out
i found that my skin
after a swim in the dead sea
the most my sister
i received this in my playbox
i initially blamed it on the weather.
it was the skin rescue
i will now be working overtime to nurse my skin back to health
but- after 2 days of use it gave me teenage acne.
i would have loved this
i'll pass it to my sister
also hated the packaging.
i've shopped with sephora for years
the former i could live with.
not a cream i use when the boyfriend is in town
it has been a brutal winter
yellow/orange as it originally was
have been a fan of dermadoctor products in the past
as someone who was born with hereditary dark circles
this is the first eye cream i've purchased
a sephora employee talked me into this cream.
i am 38yrs old
forgetting this had been the product that burned so badly
i checked the basket
i actually had a friend ask if i had stopped using eye cream
i tried the eye cram since a couple of sale people in the stores had recommended it
she was about 30 years old
i just bought this
ibought a kit that had this in it
a worker in the store convinced me to buy this after i asked her opinion on face lotions
i should have retuned
gave it to my mom who is using it
as i recently just purchased a value set of her infamous argan oil
claimed it was amazing
i cried at the sight of my skin.
when i mentioned it to a sephora rep they laughed it off
acted like i should have known to only use it on my neck
my boyfriend casually mentioned to me yesterday that my skin looked bad
i previously used premier cru the cream
i think caudalie has done a lot of reformulation recently
deducted one star for price
she recommended this product for me
tried as a recommendation by a reputable guru
the sales girl said this product would work for lines under makeup
i tried this in the store
i tried it in the store
especially for the old-lady smell that comes with it
was told this one was great
returned it for a refund.
i contacted customer service
i saw this version advertised
her praises for this mask
none of my lines disappeared
it seemed that everybody lived this
this bottle was a waste of money
the fab rep was in the store.
fab has me covered!
have loved everything from fab that i have tried in the past
i loved this product when i had a beauty consultant use it on me in the store
i did this mask before my birthday dinner.
an e-mail later
i repurchased several times.
wish i had returned it.
wanted to like but had an allergic reaction.
it was recommended to me by one of the staff at sephora
it looks like it was deleted
also bought cleanser and felt the same.
partly because i love roses
originally blamed it on that
i took it back and purchased fresh soy.
recently purchased this because i thought i would like a light rose scent in my cleanser
wish i actually lived in the city
powder that worked great with other color correcting products haven't worked well with this one for me
this worked for me
this was another one of those bought-in-the-excitement-of-just-having-had-a-makeover-purchases
i immediately purchased it.
only one previously had a reaction
not a creme as i had imagined
it was highly recommended to me at sephora store by one of the sales rep
have taken care of my skin
learned my lesson with this.
it looked like i had been crying.
a sephora associate recommended this product
when i splurged on this purchase
the title says it all.
what initially i was about to do
i regret spending that 7
one of the people from the store recommended this
jart line was recommended to me by a sales associate
then the woman at checkout raved about it
nose strips have never worked that well for me
mine wasn't burning like others
i received a packette with a purchase
this was recommended to me by an employee
none of them wowed me for the $80 price tag
i've previously used the original glamglow mud mask
i feel like i was cheated out of almost a month's usage
sadly i had to return this product
bought this in a set with the eye creme
have bought it a couple times
i tossed mine out
the woman who recommended it told me it was for day wearing
i accidently purchased this product thinking it was the eye cream
felt i needed to say that i have bought many jars over the years of the lift eye gel
i used it two days before my engagement party
this product was recommended to me by a sephora employee
with that being said
this was recommended by a sales associate
i gave it to a friend who loves it-
gave it to my mom
i wish this was in a jar
while waiting at the clinique counter a customer was wondering if it really worked
told her my age
she bought some, as did another woman.
as instructed on the bottle
i used this faithfully every morning
i wish this one have worked for me.
boy was it a mistake
i love the pump for traveling
i've purchased her cleansing oil in the past
in the old-style pump
it had been a while
bought this for my semi-dark under eye circles.
the "skin guru" in my local sephora recommended this
bought the day cream as well as the eye cream
i would not recommend this product to a friend
when sometime is labeled as a mask
i trashed it immediately
for me it's worked
i just got mine
i used this once and gagged.
loved the results after one use
i liked the product after initially using it
i learned my lesson
my friend recommended this cream to me
i even had a friend
i assumed it was allergy season
i recommended this product to my mother who is 43
my friends like it
why it garnered 3 stars from this dry faced girl
bought this thinking it was a mask
i then had my husband try it .
i could never deal with the old
none worked for me i still had makeup on
it reminds me of a dentist office.
for me it wasn't the one that worked
this is the first time in all the years i have shopped at sephora that i am returning a product
received as a vib rouge gift.
my experience was this product worked better as a facecream
although this came highly recommended by one of the sales associates at sephora
i gave it to my mother.
i only changed this is my a.m.
i managed to save it
as stated by others
a sales woman at the store convinced me to purchase this product
i found tons of foundation
i ordered this as part of the lift
neither my teenage daughter or i liked this.
it never became milky
i've spotted new milia forming
it was recommended to me by a sephora employee to reduce circles under my eyes
in a matter of hours, the gel aged me.
i am 20 years old
plus my mother said i had bags
the woman in sephora ran to this over priced product
swore all i'd need all year
i got it based on the recommendation of an employee
decided to try this product that it was recommended long time ago by a friend
bought this cream to even my skin tone
i just purchased this product at the suggestion of one of the sales associates at sephora
i wish i had bought that instead
as the title says
this was recommended to me.
since my friend likes it i'll give it to her.
the pump wasn't working
purchased with high hopes.
one star for the manufacturer
i believe it's targeted for matured skin
a sephora employee recommended it to me
some people say they notice difference immediatly
it served my needs
back to my old drugstore stand by.
bought this jar about 6 months ago.
wish this could've worked for me
bought this on recommendation on this site.
i recently purchased this mask
at first i thought it was my diet
i get married in 3 days
a sephora sales clerk talked me into buying this more expensive product
short lived result product
after photos on the marketing were almost identical
i gave it to my mom
my mother had recently started a new wrinkle product
i tried this very expensive anti wrinkle treatment for the recommended time the saleslady gave me
because the false promise made me angry
of all the products i've bought in my time
the pump has stopped working
it worked for a week like a pump should
have been dealing with acne since i was in 8th grade
figured the washer would be great
all of tata's products have an overwhelming smell of old lady
my skin is making me look like a middle-aged teenager
i mistakenly purchased this item
i am a 29 year old female.
i should've saved my money
boy was i wrong
bought this product twice
wish i had returned it.
it was finally a product that worked wonders for my eyes
i looked tired and older while using this.
all of the miracle worker line of products
decided it was time to upgrade from my drugstore br
have been using this faithfully
the cream worked well on my skin
it seemed as if it worked.
it worked well on my skin
new backup bottle that i had
the salesperson at sephora really sold me on this oil
sadly i had to return it.
i really thought i had found my own personal fountain of youth
was told by the sales rep at sephora that this was the best thing
de have received recently
assumed it was the product
i sadly returned it
sold to me by a sephora employee who swore this was the holy grail of holy grail products
recently i've had many breakouts
i liked that this bar was fragrance free
loved that about it
was told by a sephora salesperson it had a good lather
it ruined my self esteem... returned it
my 33 yr old daughter tried caudalie
i should have stuck with the product i had researched
this is a piece of junk.
if you are a teenager
this was a definite bust.
a few sephora employees i talked to felt the same
all though i have not had a sleep-deprived night since i've purchased
she said that the 'cold' feeling was the product working its magic
the other was majorette
haven't been traveling with it
a sephora employee recommended this for me since i mentioned that i have dry skin
compared with the white tea skin guardian from origins
i decided to give this product a try since i read that it was created for younger women in their twenties
i think i fell victim to marketing regarding this mask
restored a 'glow' like the description says
i am 26 years of age
i wish it had worked as well as i wanted it to
i found it worked best on my feet
received this as a gift
bought this around christmas time 2014
it was part of a kit
i used faithfully for awhile.
purchased it because i have some pimples
a sephora girl said this would help with my dehydrated skin
i received this as a gift
i wish i had saved my receipt
should have known once i saw it written at the bottom of the bottle
that version isn't supplied in stores
i got this in my sephora beauty insider birthday gift along with a cucumber mask
like most people i received this as a birthday gift
my husband used this and it worked fine with him.
i wish i hadn't spent the money in this one
i got this with the 21 birthday kit
wish i hadn't bought the full bottle after only one night of use
the sales person talked me into it--i have buyers remorse
that claimed this product would really help my crows feet
i asked the consultant at sephora what would help with my dark circles under my eyes
she recommended this product
purchased this eye treatment from sephora for $100
i am 30 years old with combination skin.
have looked for products to reduce my dark undereye circles since i was a teen
just recently i've noticed that after i apply my concealer
friend recommends this product.
for me it was a horror movie
i ran to the store to buy it
this product came highly recommended by the manager-in-training at the birmingham store
i returned it for a refund.
which is what the sales person told me it was
i used it religiously am
the cream arrived in a shipping box
i never repurchased it because it was so pricey
until it went on sale recently
i loved it for a week
i switched back to my old cleanser
originally bought glamglow for my teenage daughter's acne
my skin has been broken out
sadly i had to give this to a friend
so i took the plunge and purchased.
switched back to my old cleanser
gave it to my mom
wish it would have worked!
i chose this product bc an in store beauty advisor suggested it
bought this during the sale
by the way, i am 20 years old.
bought this from sephora consultant suggestion.
every time i applied it i smelled spoiled milk
i've never been diagnosed with rosacea
i ordered it online
received this as a gift.
i ordered this product online
when i received the product
a sephora employee recommended this product.
i would call it more of a spoiled vodka cocktail thats been sitting out for a week
i am a 45 year old woman
tried it faithfully for a month
on since its release
even if this product worked as stated
bought several bottle of this
this product was being thrown around on the internet as a miracle product a year or 2 ago
also complained that i smelled like his mom every time i used it
this was a waste of my money
like a very old woman.
if you want your sixteen year old peaches
i've purchased less expensive products that have worked better
a sephora employee brought this one to my attention
influenced me to buy it
i recently bought a tube of this stuff.
i wish the brand would return to the old formula.
le to the old one
bring back the old!!!
then suddenly the old formula is gone
i loved the original version
replaced it with this
i loved hope in a jar years ago
i regret purchasing it.
this was recommended in its place
this was one that a sales associate directed me too
was steered towards this line by a sephora associate
i swear this isn't the first time i've purchased something
the lady at sephora told me it would be a game changer
my skin has loved them
purchased as part of the duo kit with good genes.

the price of this cream is a scam.
bottle design are a hoax
i waited eagerly for the email

he said i smelled like under the hood of a vehicle
that i decided to splurge
when this new mask was released
be a big old mess

i returned that one and ordered a new bottle.
over all i could tell this bottle was just old

even though i had reservations
nothing worked for me
asked an employee to help me pick out a cleanser
it murdered my skin.
it worked so well
wish i hadn't purchased the kit.
i originally bought this product because of the review videos on youtube not realizing that it was making my skin worse
i actually believed the ads i saw that allure was raving about this product
