looking at the picture
which means you have to dig it out or slam it out
my face is breaking out more
balled up in spots
had to wash it off
especially around my jaw
this had an unpleasant sticky feeling that took forever to go away
it also balled up on random parts of my face.
woke up to my normal skin.
it also left my skin feeling very oily/greasy for the next couple days
when i put it on after 5 minutes i can see this blue tint left over
even after taking it off i had to wash my face multiple times to get rid of the smell
i can still touch my face
after an hour it still didn't soak in
i found that if i touched my face this stuff would pill
come off in little balls
i needed to wash it off
my eyelids are pretty loose because i've been using double lid tapes too much
i did not see my under eyes fine lines go away
i did a patch test on my left cheek
tried it right away
until i realized that it only feels tightening because the alcohal content in the mask is just drying out my skin which in the long run ends up aging you quicker
even though the dead skin
the chemicals in it must be so harsh because the foil seal in mine had been melted by the product
the next morning my face felt super clean
my friends were hyping me up about this mask
it practically peeled off in one piece
and no, i'm not putting it near my mouth!
spend it on the super mud instead
it peels off very well after 30 minutes
sticking to my glamglow supermud mask instead.
it gummed up making it hard to remove
it peels right off
while it can make it feel plumped up
maybe it helped pulling dead skin off in the peel part
the hype over this mask
which alone cut it out of my morning routine
my skin gets a lot of bumps all over the day after i use it
tried it after washing my face
i waited around for it to absorb into my skin
let it sit for 5 min before putting my moisturizers on
i woke up with 2 zits.
it just sits on top of the skin even overnight
think an extra layer would've been complete chaos for my skin
spend a lot of time in the sun because of my job
weighing the pay-off of that with the tackiness is leaves on my skin
instead it made me break out.
once i stopped using it the bumps all went away in a matter of a day
however it just stayed too sticky for a while after applying
every time you push the top down to close it
the ball tip is nice for "massaging" around the eyes however
i would just wipe off with my finger
through out the day
i didn't noticed it balling up or wanting to come off whenever i wore makeup
it continued to happen under both of my eye lids
otherwise i'd throw it away.
my under eye area got darker after using this
just sits on top
the tube also ended up getting pretty messy with the design of it
i don't have heavy dark circles under my eyes
still had bags, still looked puffy.
i got this in the summer hoping to fix my seriously dark circles around my eyes
bottom of my travel bag
every time you close it some product squirts out
i will have to cut it open to use what's left
i don't find it to do as it claimed to mask my sleep deprived under eyes
when l would look in the mirror
i put this on as my day eye cream.
the all about eyes
made my under eye make up ball up and really dry.
when you push the cap back
my sleep is all over the place
you have to put a lot of product for it to work without pulling on the delicate skin under your eyes
this made my skin look like i rubbed bacon grease all over my face after being outside for 10mins
the texture just doesnt sit right on my skin
as a result i ended up layering this on top of other moisturizer
it is murder if it gets in your eyes.
it made my skin break out
every time i put it on it runs into my eyes then stings which causes tearing
prefect for bed or going out
disappeared leaving my skin feeling drier than before i put it on
both times it burned quite badly as soon as i put the pads on top
this product didn't last more than 20 seconds before it was scalding hot under the pad
on cracked skin it is good
magically gave me 10x the fine lines under my eye in 15 minutes
this one goes in the trash
the pads sometimes stayed on well
the pads that you put on under your eyes on top of the cream will not stay on
those pads were huge on me
i really wanted this product to work to tighten the lower eye lid area
after using this at night i wake to my crows feet being very deep in the morning
also tried just my finger as well
it causes make up to pill badly
putting liquid foundation on over this is a nightmare because the foundation does not spread over it smoothly
it will rub off
it also flakes off when you apply make up.
this is a complete disappointment and a rip off.
when i applied my make-up over it
it was as if i were trying to apply make-up over white glue
then i’ll layer this on.
i can see a change in my left side near my mouth
this is my sleeping side
i tend to push my face into the pillow
that pesky line between my eyes
i only have a few wrinkles near my lips on the left side of my face
the wrinkles i am fighting are only on the left side of my face
behold this is the side i used to sleep on
tell you which side you sleep on
i also read that you need to use silk pillowcases to really help save your face
as a mask, should i use it as a sleeping mask???
if you try to put makeup on over it the makeup beads up
it pilled up on my face so much i had to wash it off
when i woke up the next day the skin on my nose was peeling
this cream made me break out
i could barely spread it over my face because the second i spread it over one cheek i could already feel it clogging my pores
the smell is kind of off putting
put it on the back of your h
in fact i have darker bags under my eyes
my skin tone could use some brightening up
this caused the skin around my eyes to sting a little upon application
my skin seems to soak in this product almost immediately
my fine lines are still there
hard to get out of the shaker
you have to shake it so hard
after shaking it into your h
upon hitting your h
this item sits on my vanity screaming to be used
so there it sits.
nothing where i needed to be rung out or running to the sink for a good wash
this is just a souped up version of kate's dermalquench
now i'm using my old mask trying to correct all the mess i have on my skin
it might help me from picking
if your skin is prone to acne stay away from this
it cleans out everything all right
it's worked so well to clear up the blackheads i've had on my chin forever
clean then i recommend this one
then it also reminds me of bug spray
this cleanser made me break out
had to keep washing it off
i've had a clarisinic brush for 2 years now
my face felt dirty after using
this made my skin red and break out.
and then it sticks to it and is hard to get off.
save your money, get the mask.
i woke up with really puffy eyes
the fine lines once again remained gone for about a day after patching
ended up with that weird wrinkle again
did leave my under-eyes smooth
i couldn't get a drop out of the roller ball
've taken to tapping it on my fingers then patting on my eyes
they left an imprint outline under my eyes for hours
this product has a horrible delivery system as i have kept the roller ball delivery system upsdie down all day
i don't see any difference in the fine lines around my eyes
save yourself the month and $125.
after 5 minutes i washed it off
it the second you touch your face or put anything on topof it
it just breaks away
unfortunately within a minute it clumps
it's embarrassing to have to keep wiping away the clumps
i love putting it on my face
pull off in little tiny balls
if i touched my face the product literally rubbed off
across my face the product itself would start peeling off
sometimes when putting it on
then it starts to ball up
just plain old putting it on my bare
still feels like i'm putting something nasty onto my face
it made me break out in some areas
it all balled up
it balled up all over my face
stopped because i was breaking out in explosive whiteheads all over my face
i would wake up with new zits literally every day
it also would ball up all over my face even if i put it on bare skin
this broke me out and was super sticky and heavy.
this cream went on smoothly enough.
the cream began to pill/ball up.
use another face cream instead
it was balling up
it broke my face out with tiny little bumps all over
it balled up on my skin
i really had high hopes for my jar of whipped argan oil face
i just made my own.
it just feels like rubbing big rocks on your face
it made my face sweat under the mask
as a mask i give this 5 stars.
two for the mask
masks usually lift up dirt
had a bunch of built up dirt
i keep my face clean.
this product does remove my make-up
does get my face clean
no cleanser has done this before
because it actually washes off clean
fresh after using it
lined using this product
you also have to use another product to remove eye make-up
this product didn't blow me away
gave it 3 for the clean feeling
while you get that squaky clean feeling
i keep it in my shower
the after taste in my mouth caused me to stop it immediately
my face seemed more oily by the end of the day.
this smelled wayyyy too strong to leave on your face for 20 minutes
that smell turns me off from it
i could rub lemons on my face for an hour
the smell is a little off putting
i try a lot of face masks
because i could still move my face w/ no stiff feel
my face gets irritated or i wake up the next day with break outs
the scent was so strong it started to make me dizzy
i washed it off immediately.
i just hope my pores shrink back down in the coming days :/
to the point my eyes watered a little
the whole time i'd wake up with new
made my skin break out into little bumps
he did the face mask with me
the bottle says to leave it on for 15-20 min.
my experience left me with the opposite
this product sat on top of the skin like grease.
it also messed up my makeup when i put it on.
removed all my makeup
just used it as a eye shadow base which did work well
on days when i do where sheer foundation
i can't get it out because the pump mechanism can't rise up to the very top of the bottle due to the rounded top
the pliers are coming out next.
sits on top of the skin
break up all over my cheeks
by the evening i had little bumps all over my face
then i started to get these horrible breakouts on my face
i decided to stick with bare minerals even after they revamped it
like i hadn't washed my face at all
immediately switched back to my rosebud salve
i feel like i'm wasting product by clicking away to try
get a decent amount spread on my face
then roll it onto my palm
then pat it in
i used it on my elbows hoping it soften them up some
use the rest of the sample later-----it will leak everywhere
then it has a roller ball that you apply the oil to your face
the play box insert said this was ok for hair.
you're being seriously ripped off
really pepped me up in the am
then i tried it all over as a body oil
don't put it on your face!
tried putting it on rough parts of my body instead
i tried it under makeup
it did not absorb into my skin but sat upon it.
instead it made me break out so badly overnight
it goes away quickly
as well i have noticed some acne spots popping up on the areas i applied the balm on
following the suggestion to leave it in the fridge
then i noticed this sticky film mess left behind
guess who threw there cooling water out.
it also left my skin feeling tight
i kept it in the fridge for a quick cool-me-down
the smell puts me off a bit
i woke up the next day to a face full of clogged pores
it is a nightmare to apply in the middle of the day when you feel dehydrated because it is way too greasy
avoid drinking water 1 hour before bed
well i do sleep almost 11 hours a night
the smell is so off putting
show up under makeup
or mess things up if i reapply it during the day
hard to apply around your eyes or nose
aside from the initial pleasant feeling
cooling effect wears away within 10 seconds
just like somebody washed the table cloth
let's break it down
cons: large surface area= horrible for getting around your under eyes
feels great when putting on right away then leaves a sticky
also made me break out with big pimples the next day
the feeling quickly fades away
this product feels nice when you first swipe it on
prepare to get a nasty shock when you touch your face later
every 2 hours if you're out in the sun for that long
nose during the day
it did break out my chin
down to my foot cream
when everyone knows you need at least 30 spf for daily sun protection
it made my face look so greasy that i switched to only using it at night
my skin was more broken out
by the end of the day before i wash my face
i now use it under my eyes for extra moisture there during the day
leaves a light film on top of my face
i tried it under makeup
tried it alone without makeup
heavy by mid-day that i have to wash my face at work
immediately after use it left your face with a little shine which was annoying
morning after my normal face washing routine
almost immediately my skin started to clear up
hate putting on under makeup because it leaves my blemishes dried out
this product sort of sits on top of my skin
it just didn't blow me away to keep me interested for daytime use
i quickly washed it off
the redness didn't completely subside for 5 days
this did not clean my makeup off good also after cleansing two times it still felt like i had something on my face i had to use another cleanser to get it off
it does sting if it runs into your eye
if you want your face masks to work better just stream or use hot water on the face so the pores are open
my mask went on smoothly
just wash your face
put your mask on
once you put the mask on top
face masks are already packed with good ingredients
it shoots the product at your face
a nice soft mist would would have kicked this up to 4 stars
sometimes it all ends up on the top part of my face
while it did help my mask go on smoothly
just wash/steam your face
in my mind if the mask needs a primer than something's missing in the first place
instantly my skin felt like i just lit it on fire
then out a mask over it
while it set up nicely for the mask
gave it a whirl with 2 masks that i own
then cleansing your face of the mask
it's like shooting yourself in the face with a high pressure hose
so you would need three sprays for one cheek to cover the entire cheek area
even when doing just half a spray each time
your better off picking up purity
despite spending a few minutes massaging the cleanser on the skin to really break up
lift the days dirt off the skin
when i went to tone the cotton pad would be evidence that the skin was still not properly cleaned
left a slippery feeling on my face
just average about getting your face free of all makeup
my face wasn't clean
when i looked in the mirror to put moisturizer on
it left a horrible film on my skin
with out make up
this cleanser seems to leave a film behind
even in the shower
it does however clean everything off
it left this residue that was really hard to rinse off
as soon as i stopped using it my face cleared up.
i'll just stick to my drugstore face wash that works way better for me
followed by the khiels face wash to wash the oil off
my mild acne cleared up from it
in the process clear up acne
bring back the old cleanser please!!!!!!
it left my skin feeling clean in a bad way
with a bunch of break-outs as well
i gave it some time to see if my skin would calm down
this product stings the eyes if i get too close.
instead they almost stick
bring the old line back...please!!
there were still some remnants of face make up left over as well as my eye make up
still had makeup on after a good scrub
some times i wipe my face with a cleansing wipe
still find make up residue on the wipe
my skin started to tighten up
as it just kept foaming up
assumed that was because i'd had to keep rubbing my face to remove the cleanser
it ended up to be my body lotion which was still not enough in winter
my complexion just isn't responding to it
so put off by this experience
my skin calmed down
put on my night cream
it brought back the burn
leave it on overnight
made me break out and didn't brighten up my skin.
going to buy their sleeping facial instead!
stays as oilslick on your face
made me break out a bit
it breaks me out
it stung my eyes so bad.
i literally put this on my wrist
i would pass this one up
applying once almost every night before bed
it burns if you get it anywhere near your eye area
my face is breaking out :
now i have to get rid of my old scars
it was like putting straight perfume on your face
then applied to my crows feet
the filling part is terrible i tried for a week to get my concealer to go on smoothly over top of this
like its there then poof
the moment i applied it to my face i got this uncomfortable stinging sensation
good if you can get pass the stinging sensation
instead of doing what it claims to do it dried my skin out
woke up with bumps
i'll use this before my make up including face primer
when i put on my foundation it is super patchy
hydrating first thing in the morning or before bed
the moisturizer gave me little bumps around my jaw line
i left it on for a bit to see if it would sink into my skin
it just ended up drying out
i washed it off immediately
it just dried my entire face out
i hate having to dip my fingers into it
then it does away
kept making excuses for it
started breaking out around my lips badly
i used make up removal before before cleanser
you can achieve the same results just tapping your eye with your fingers
my work makes my eyes super tired by the end of the day
just wanted some eye massage
there is a weird paper covering on the end
others up from my local sephora
even with watering it down
it barely strips down the first layer of makeup
watering eyes for 30 minutes afterwards
the kind that lets you press down on the top
instantly my face felt hot
makes me look dewy before i even get out of the door in the morning
the lotion does sting a little at first after application
just in hopes of it making my skin fab
i put them back in the container
turned it upside down
stung when i put them under my eyes
my eyes felt cool while patches were on my under eyes
could try out the eye patches before buying
was extra careful when sealing the top
that made them so dry it felt like i was just sticking tape around my eyes
refreshing on your face in the morning
on the plus side
my dark circles started to disappear.
then underneath my eyes
when i say pills up
i keep this in the fridge
use it as a wake me up eye mask in the morning while i have my coffee before my shower
the eye cream is a definite let down
causes any makeup i put on top of it to ball up
the 2 3 lines i have under my eyes
just an everyday eye cream.
the fuss over this mask
when i scoop it up
i kept thinking the kids had left some snack under the sofa before realizing that it was me
i put this on before bed
i woke up to breakouts all over my face
this product did not work at fading dark spots.
it caused my skin to break out
after using the whole bottle
woke up with multiple huge whiteheads
because it caused me to break out
walking around with breakouts to find out
it cause bumps everywhere i put it
within a month the bumps spread to every single spot i put this on
instead this gave me pimples on areas i never break out on
by the next afternoon i had 5 little white pimples all around my face
my night cream does more for me then this mask.
made my face sting.
not broken me out
every time i used it i got a blemish.
i swiped it on my cheeks as a highlighter for a nice finish
was closer to a match for my skin tone
the extra "highlight" in the cap was a cool idea
my makeup broke up on my face
the flip cap gets in the way
want my face to breathe without all the makeup
arms before going out
i put it on before foundation
then stick with it
i don't see any lift or firming going on.
although it did firm/tighten the skin on my face
takes away from any chance of looking like a natural beauty
when you first pump it out the smell is unbearable
le the smell especially since its going on my face reminding me that i'm putting chemicals on my skin
was nice to use at night to seal in all my heavier night products
just from breathing in the scent all day long
it also gave me three huge blackheads on my cheek where i usually would never get them
as soon as i stopped using this product my skin cleared up
made my skin break out
but it ruined my skin.
the rest of my face is normal
also noticed it really set into your creases
i gave it plenty of time to soak in
when applying my foundation it basically rolled into balls on my face which is unlike anything i've ever experienced
it pills up consistently into little balls on my skin
am break out prone
sits on top of your skin
it literally comes off in clumps like 20 minutes after you put it on
could smell it from the other room
felt heavy enough to sleep in
every time i used it, i got a huge pimple
just put my coconut oil on my face after my routine instead
at first when i applied it it felt like my skin just started to sweat profusely
which i refuse to give up
caused my lm to just kind of sit on top of skin
when i put makeup on
it sits on my face
my eyes looked tired and my wrinkles looked deep.
the only thing it did was give my eyes a tingling while i applied it
despite wearing well under foundation
fine lines around my eyes
i still had to put a moisturizer over top of it
ended up drying my skin instead.
woke up with very smooth skin though.
woke up to about 10 small pimples
'm just stuck using it
got this in de let's b clear set
ended up having to mix it in with my other moisturizer
then my daily moisturizer on top
my face felt tight after application
it just lingers around
my friend let me have practically a full jar of this
skin has been flaring up around the eyes
i loved it until it the scent hit my nose.
it just seemed like any over-the-counter moisturizer
when you start rubbing it in
my whole face broke out into little white bumps
this new stuff is like my kid smashed a banana all over my face
made my face break out
it has now been relegated to a neck moisturizer until i use up the sample
the new forumlation of the product has caused my skin to break out
every time is dries down on my face.
then face is red afterwards
it says to leave it on until it foams up
the product literally foams as i'm putting it onto my face
it goes on my face well in the shower
i will just use it as a face wash
left a weird residue on my face.
i always end up with some of it on my counter
stay on my face for a good 10-15 mins
it just temporarily covers them
this just tightens under your eye for a while
my skin is past that stage
i've tried putting it on before my moisturizer
it even pilled after putting it on without any moisturizer
i put some on the top of my h
dry i thought my face would crack if i smiled
i extend it down on my decollete
it left gold glitter in my face
night on my face
in just 2 weeks i realize the bottle is empty
it was almost gagging to me at times.
that's literally all i've noticed about it.
until it was empty to give the product a proper chance
i wash my face at night
when you put it on your skin
it made me break out in certain spots on my face
i put it on my face
except for around my nose
i could wipe my face with a hundred dollars bill
i will finish off the bottle because it was too expensive to throw away
took a couple seconds to absorb into my skin
nothing works overnight-nothing.
it didn't go away all day even after i washed it off
this did not leave my skin feeling stripped after washing
my face feels fresh after i use this
this made my skin feel stripped after every use
it has started spraying across the room
straight in the air when i try to pump it out
it gets on my clothes and all over my bathroom.
i usually lather up twice
the skin is back to clear
it took so long to clear up my skin even after i stopped using it
there was a period where i was in tears looking at my face without makeup because it caused so many problems for my skin
it looks dark then really light with one swipe
had thing in your bag
didn't help with black under the eyes
stays on all day
my skin cleared up
it felt like it took an hour to absorb.
it hasn't broken me out which is good
tingles a bit when i put it on
the corner of my eyes
but the brightening claim didnt work for me.
figured the smell would subside
i could smell it throughout my entire 10 hour shift at work
plus it's in a jar which is a big thumbs down
pills up like crazy2.
before realizing that it was the moisturizer causing this
while still using this product almost as a recovery treatment for my upper lip
i found the scent off putting
it has some fine lines
middle of the road moisturizer.
it turns out to be very sticky about an hour after i apply it
aside from the bumps
it took me one week to get rid of these bumps.
it left me with a headache.
nope it literally broke my skin out.
the shine while using highlighters without making it more of a challenge with this lotion will just stick with what is working for me
then i noticed that my makeup was cracking
after about 5 min of putting it on
it turned out to be just a regular moisturizer
literally makes little skin looking flakes when i put my foundation over it
when i'd wake up in the morning i'd have texture
this product wrecked by combination skin
i know it caused my skin to have a few extra whiteheads when i woke up after using it the evening beforeh
when you put the moisturizer on it sinks in quickly
i'll be throwing the rest of the sample away.
it feels like i am just pushing around product on top of my skin
then it melts into water on your face
this moisturizer has set my skin back
it basically turned into water
it just feels like you're patting water onto your face
with a mist before i'm ready to put on something heavier for overnight
i am just now getting my skin cleared up from this
i need to put my other moisturizer on top
it sinks right into the skin
the bottle ended up at the bottom of my makeup collection
i applied it on my face before going to bed
i end up getting a pig underground pimple within 24 hours
it just sits on top of it
woke up with 20 little pimples
let it sink it
found myself layering my normal eye cream over top of this to prevent my under eyes from drying out
i struggle with darkness under my eyes.
i think it might've broken me out
at night i noticed in the morning when i put it on before i apply my makeup that when i go to apply my foundation it goes on evenly
my skin cleared out without issues after i stopped using it
of course i live 2 hours from the nearest sephora
after adding it to my night routine
my make up comes off so easy now.
when wearing it alone
it wasn't pleasant waking from my sleep overnight
tight in the morning
it balled up all over my skin
left me feeling greasy in summer
my face was red
things are loosening up
i started breaking out everywhere on my face
i literally felt i was putting on lip balm under my eye
even if i wake up without blotchy
irritated skin around my eyes i'd never pay full price for this product
instead i'd purchase skyn's eye pen
i like to use it as i'm waking up or during the day as a re-fresher because it helps awaken my eyes a bit
i put it in the refrigerator
then use my other eye cream afterwards
keep you in the habit of taking one pill everyday so you keep with your routine
ended up prying the product back before buying
brighten my bags due to sleepless nights
make me look more alive
#2 this one is gut wrenching even though i'm a two time over rouge this year
the lid doesn't close
the lid just spins into place
be prepared for a mess in the shower
i like this for chest/back as i run daily
your face will soak it up" when i asked what the main ingredients were
they were all acne treatments i was a little put off because my skin is clear
had red all over my sink
it made my foundation desperate
i only use it before the gym now
i put this on under makeup
giving it two stars because i like the smell
i put a separate moisturizer on top of it.
it feels just like i'm splashing some water on my face
after washing my face using it
feel like i was literally throwing money down the drain
stay away from this product
i don't keep a bowl in my bathroom
i couldn't open my eyes for a minute because they stung
cannot wait to wash my face in the morning
they hold up well
it broke me out super bad on my chin
i once put some sunscreen over it too early
my makeup is disappear right after few mins
the foundation sits on top of it
tapped it in until my face was numb
broke up my foundation around my nose
it does sink it to the face after a while which is a plus
i noticed my makeup just sliding off.
erasing my makeup only 3-4 hours after
i followed the directions perfectly
after 2 days of use my skin has broken out.
i only use this as a nighttime sleeping mask
after a few weeks of using it i like that i wake up with "shiny" in the good way skin
it holds your makeup in place all day
keeps your face mat
felt nothing close to a "corset" tightening
i did try using it without getting it under my eyes just to keep my makeup in place
leave it in my shower
wait a bit then splash my face with water
this has cut down my oil like no one business.
i did my usual morning routine adding this after my water based moisturizer
had to stifle my screams
it actually appeared to break my foundation up on multiple areas
thought i'd try this as i hate carrying around blotting papers
help keep my makeup in place
an over-the-make-up product
my makeup gets all messed up
it was like adding water to my face
underneath my foundation as a primer looked good for about an hour
you still see the shine
i tried mixing it with my foundation.
patted on top as a touch up
transferring off my face
a touch up through out the day
as a touch-up product
look in the mirror
i did like touching up with it because it seemed as if i had freshly applied my makeup
checked myself in the mirror on the way out
by noon, i was my usual shiny self.
didn't take off makeup when applied over
my foundation just melted away when i applied this
i put it under my foundation
i put it on top of my foundation
my face stay shiny all over
also tried applying on top of makeup when my face turned shiny
my face was back to oily after a couple of hours
make them go away
i've also noticed if it gets too close to my eyes it gets in my contacts
it is hard to use any liner or heavy eye make up after applying the cream
tingled a bit when i put it on
when i would use this in the morning or fresh out of the shower it felt awful
my face began to clear up
my skin cleared up
woke up feeling greasy
i waited for the breakup to disappear
skin is breaking out.
my skin feels greasy at the end of the day
used it this evening after i washed my face
i looking in the mirror
it ended up feeling like a very heavy coat of protection i was putting on at night
it almost feels like a pore filling primer going all over your face
i swear by the entire line
placed my primer on
not 2 hours later i had enough oil on my face to fry chicken
seems to sink no in without being to heavy
this is without walking outside in the wind.
this feels like you are putting shaving cream on your face
wearing it under makeup just makes it melt off my face sooner
bring the product into the center of your face
the foundation just balls up or moves around on the face
all it did was give my face an extra shine
just hovers on top
left skin patchy wherever it wore off
i would put this over my primer
you can't escape it.
applied it to a bare face only on the high points like you would a highlighter
the half moon around the eyes etc
when i put it on it made my face way to greasy
which i found kind of off-putting
despite the "nude" tag
after using my new favorite product i found myself breaking out along my jaw
my skin felthydrated all day.
it just falls short
each time i find myself reaching for another moisturizer
for about 5 minutes until you go out in the sunlight
i put foundation on top
after a while even with primer
smells like a orange push-up
i still have to put another moisturizer on top
scoop it out as then it will contaminate the product
i started getting red bumps all over my skin
even when paired with my clairesonic
it's a never ending journey trying to find a product that can keep my skin in check during the muggy summer months
beware it is literally jet black
i've had to wipe down my entire sink
shower after every use
i should've trusted my gut because it gave me a small breakout on my cheek
don't get it anywhere close to your eyes
stay on your mid cheek because it will abuse your skin
i dropped it on a carpeted floor
the center of the cap that locks inside the tube to hold it in place broke
leaving a hole in the center for product to spill out
there would be make up on the towel when i dried my face
thought a 2 in 1 would cut corners
i still had to soap my eyes
i think i'll go back to soaping
i ended up with small whiteheads on my nose:
ball up when i apply this
right off the bat
the product didn't blow me away
it does go away
i struggled with pretty bad grease by the middle of the day
i just didn't think it kept my make up in as 'good' condition throughout the day
by the end of the workday
just crumpled my makeup up
no where on the packing
throwing them in our play boxes?
i put this on under the it cosmetics bb cream i received in my play bag
when i went to put on concealer with just this underneath
it completely broke up as i tried to apply it with a beauty blender :
that all the skin on my face was peeling like crazy
had to wash it off halfway through the morning because it was so thick
my makeup fell off through the day in a horrible streaky mess
this just kind of set off the oil everywhere at work:/
it works for her skin just fine
if you rub your face it will start to ball up
in the morning i wipe my face off.
ball up if i rubbed my skin at all after it dried
after applying or try throughout the day if rubbed at all it clumps into little balls on your face
use all of the following every single day: their take the day off balm remover
their face mist to freshen up throughout the day or at the gym
this hydroblur moisturizer was a definite pass for me
always do a patch test before putting a product all over my face
before putting it on my face
it was actually just an empty little box
made me break out big time
it did smooth down
all of the dryness was front and center.
the rest of my face looked fine.
right after i put it on my face i could feel a cooling sensation
it starts to peel off
i've noticed that every time i wear it under my makeup
it did not live up to the fascinating description of "diamond dust
my skin immediately started to clear up
i ended up with more small white bumps on my chin
ended up with clusters of bumps
on my lunch break i completely washed my face it was that bad
the smell is down right gross
hoping the scent would go away
this kiss of death for this product was that it caused small white heads to break out across my nose after two uses
i found that it took numerous swipes to remove my make up
wearing it under makeup made my foundation break apart after a couple of hours
will be throwing out the rest of the bottle
then i started getting acne on my cheeks
i think it is causing my break outs
i will use it at night as a neck cream
this is the only thing i changed in my routine
it's a very thick formula that just sat on top of my skin all night
i couldn't wait to wash it off when i woke up.
or a baby right after a bath
basically it just looks like a rubbed a ton of body glitter all over my face
only by adding a bunch of gold glitter on your face
which it really falls short on
hoping this goes away quickly!
i don't have time to wait 30-40 min every morning before applying my makeup
exchanged it for the water cream
ing outside in a complete rain storm
my skin was like an oil slick by the end of the day
kept my makeup from lasting
the next day i looked like a grease monkey
the rest of my face is normal
the only thing i can do is use the boscia charcoal blot papers then come back with a loose powder
i saved up to try out some of the tatcha items
this one just sits on my desk for me to run out of my other moisturizers
sat on top of my skin until it balled up with my foundation
my face kept sticking to my pillowcase
definitely needs to dry before laying down to go to bed especially for those that sleep on your side or stomach
when it dried on my skin it was so darn sticky that i threw the rest of the sample away
now i gotta go wash my rest along with other skincare products that i've put on my face
i just washed it off
its fine to use before makeup or as a nightime product
i layed my face down a good while after putting it on
my pillow case stuck to my face
i am going back to my bioderm aquasource gel moisturiser instead
it keeps the oil away
however instead of mattifying my face
it leaves a film over my face.
i need to constantly blot my face all day when i wear it
causing my makeup to come off
my makeup looks like it's slouching off within a couple of hours since i started using this
it would be annoying to try to keep it from coming out of the container or breaking off while using it after it's broken at the bottom
i've still got marks left that i'm trying to fade
keep in mind i exfoliate my face twice a day
i keep it in the shower.
keep in mind that i used this after removing all makeup with my favorite makeup wipes
after a 4 day vacation using this instead of my normal cream cleanser
my eyes became watery right after i applied it
made my face a little red after peeling off
this mask made my whole face break out.
while applying this mask it instantly made my eyes water
i let sit for about 15 mins
it peeled off pretty easily
left a bunch behind that needed to be washed off
my eyes were watering as i was applying it on to my face
on top of that i didn't see a difference after peeling it off
almost impossible to remove by peeling- expect to spend 20-30 minutes trying to get it off
when you are finally free of this awful mask
it just kept peeling only small bits
it literally made my eyes water
by peeling off i mean
my skin comes off
had to wash it off.
it hurt so bad that there were tears running down my face
it left my skin so red
it hurt so much peeling it that tears were running down my face
completely dried out my skin while the dirt remained in my poors
slap it on your face
after 10 minutes it was impossible to peel off
had to wash it off
after 10 minutes it was still impossible to peel off
ended up washing it off again.
i ended up just taking it off with a wash cloth which took a lot of scrubbing
i ended up just washing it off my face with warm water
i would have been better off sticking tape to my face
made it hard to keep them open
when i apply this mask on my eyes just watered for a long time
tolerable since they did go away as it dried
this mask was hard to peel off
felt like peeling packing tape off my face
i've never been a fan of peel off masks
i think it took off every little hair on my face
once i put it on my face my eyes watered for a good 5 minutes due to the alcohol in the mask
needed something to refresh dull looking skin during the change of season
the smell of rubbing alcohol is so strong when applying it's uncomfortable to breathe or open eyes until it goes away
my grind said she felt fumes on her eyes
especially when you're applying around the nose area
it goes away quickly as it dries
it hurt a lot to peel it off
when i removed it
leaving my skin shiny as if i had used an oil on my face
after reading up on this
just opted for rewashing my face
my skin is still has make up residue left
my advice is to use it as a cleanser in a morning rutine when you wake up
so no make up on.
my skin felt clean and didn't break out.
i'll use up the bottle
i've cleaned it out thinking a leaf got stuck or something
you have to clean more than once to get that clean effect
i tried to stick with it for a couple of weeks to let my skin adjust
with the tea leaves staying in the bottle
it stung my eyes
something was off about this cleanser
so definitely remove the make up first with an oil based cleanser or makeup remover
this product works best after you remove your make up with a cleansing cloth first
it lingered in my face
s for more than 20min after i washed my face
my skin was left tight
i felt like it left a layer of oil sitting on top of my skin
then you try to use it as a soap to wash it off
i ended up using another soap to get this soap off
so have to top it up with a face powder!
it feels heavy on my face
not even 5 minutes later i have to reapply a different lotion just to get rid of the dryness
clean break,double duty etc etc.
go for jack black dry erase instead
if your face is an oil slick year round this clean break is your golden ticket
within just a few hours i was wiping oil off my forehead
i work night shift
did nothing for the lines in my neck
i like the feeling when using it as a night cream
it really starts to ball up when i apply my sunscreen or base afterwards
not impress had to wash my face right away to get rid of the feeling
when we're smearing their product right around our noses???
when i went on with my makeup routine it started peeling off
everything started peeling off
it still peeled off
put a foundation over this
my skin is messed up big time.
still got white heads
however there was no product up where the paper covers the container
this product popped up when i typed moisturizer for dry skin the the search bar
it just sinks into the skin
it seemed like every other day i would get a new zit on my face
just like that bam zits popped up
after maybe like 5 minutes when it dries up
instead of coming out in a gentle pump
it came out in such a fast stream that it went everywhere
then dealing with the smell
it lingers ever after removing it.
it took about three washes to get all of it off
when i tried to remove my eye make-up
which is the opposite of clean
heavy only after 20 minutes of wearing it
i washed it frantically off as soon as i patted it on
i needed a day cream to mix with my foundation.
foundation lay on top of my skin
roll off my face when touched
i throw it in the garbage
water on my face
or save up for this
it left a sticky residue that did eventually sink in
want a moisturizer that can be followed by primer+foundation within 5 minutes
it stung on my face.
even when touching my face i heard an audible sticky release that made me immediately wash it off
which always catches me off guard when i go my makeup half asleep at like 6am
which is a turn off for me
went away after it absorbed fully
then i started to break out on my cheeks
t was really easy to waste since it's so loose half the bottle came out when i squeezed
looking at the rest of the ingredients
my face is covered in little bumps
especially along the jaw
using this product i got about 4 hours of intact makeup
side note it has a very off putting scent.
it doesn't look gross when i wake up in the morning
i woke up with a blemish on my cheek.
woke up to a new zit on my chin
my face was still sticky like when i first applied
this feels like it just sits on top
just sits on top
it also left my face shiny all day.
rough going on to me
when used under makeup it makes my foundation break up
kept me oil free for 8-12 hours
i can still feel the product after swiping my h
did not help keep my skin shine free
i only got about one hour of matte out of it.
it pilled if i tried to put primer over it
when it comes to putting it on my face because within a few minutes i feel like i have just moisturized my face with cooking oil
this make my skin dryer than before
i tried applying it immediately after i washed my face
it doesnt break me out
i end up using another cleanser after it to get rid of the film
i still found some makeup would come off after using cleansing water
3rd because the product was so thick it would just sit on top of my face
cause everything i put on top to ball up
looked in the mirror
i still looked like a disco ball
give you the sensation of being refreshed based on the description
i would have to wash my face at least 3 times from wearing a light summer foundation
little pieces from the cotton pad would start to stick on my face
i immediately had to wash it off my face.
didn't add it to my makeup routine instead after cleansing at night i applied every night while the product does last long
had to wash it off
smooth in the morning
i only placed 2 drops on my face
after only using it twice i've totally broken out with pimples
when i wake up with sleeping with it on my face
i break out a lot
i never broke out on my chin
with more scars then before
i applied it before putting on my makeup before work
it literally popped up from this oil in that short amount of time
my stubborn break outs are still there
my face cleared up
down the side of my face
i experienced full-blown purging with this product to the point that i had to return it
it'll set up like concrete
i'd pass on this on.
felt like wax got stuck on me.
you have to dig hard to get a chunk of the product out
it left my skin kind of red,also.
i've tried massaged it into my face
the fruit chunks are hard to wash off
after washing the product off
it is a mess to deal with
i got some in my hair
it stuck straight out from my head
i let the mask sit for 15 minutes
also, the water just kept beading up on my face.
i finally ended up washing it off with my cleanser
then my skin texture felt ruined — as if my moisture barrier had been completely stripped
with the same success you can put on the face some orange jam
my face just broke out horribly my chin my forehead just not what i expected
felt like i was just spreading mashed up peaches
oranges all over my face
after 10 minutes it dried on my face feeling like that was exactly what i put on my face
if it had made me break-out from all the sugar
the smell from opening this up is like peeling open an orange
another pointless fresh product.
i've gone through an entire bottle
only apply it to the dark spots on my skin
the double spout makes it impossible to open up the container
i actually tried to wipe it off
not end up with red eyes
it seems to just fade into my skin
the "diamond dust" settles into any fine lines you have
when i put makeup over it it just balled up
this eye cream will end up looking like you have poorly under-eye concealer: it is a pale pink
about halfway through my day i noticed it started crusting up around the outside of my eyes
it looked like i put highlighter on my eyes.
this would be a good mask for right before applying makeup for a night out
it's to "lighten skin" overtime from sun damage
the mask in the new bottle comes out in a semi-clear
its hard to peel off
i'll keep it in rotation until i finish this bottle
it made my whole face red
breaks apart and comes off in tiny pieces.
maybe it removed some of my dead skin
it got rid of dead skin though
hasn't helped my fine lines
one of them balled up
it felt like putting chapstick under my eye
on the third day i developed a very red burning patch on one cheek
my skin is ending up worse
wash my face two times a day
maybe the oil in the stick is causing me break out
i like how the mask warms up
the warming sensation was very harsh on my skin within a minute i had to rinse it off it felt like my face was on fire
then massaged it in
the directions say to massage for two minutes which i did thinking the burning would subside
the directions also advise to leave the mask on for 10 -15 minutes
it also get stuck under my nails
hence 2 stars taken off
make it a little bit soft for a couple hrs after using it
tried to pair it with the firming night balm after each use
how it turns into a cream
instead started to feel more like pop rocks on my face
almost as if i put too faced's lip injection all over
when i rinsed it off after 20 minutes of it on my face
because the thickness of the mask i think it ends up trapping the debris once it starts to draw up
i woke up looking like i’d left my face in the sun all day
have broken out after each use
it literally felt like i put jam on my face.
after washing it off my face felt a little greasy
it still was burning
my face is red
the rest of my samples are going in the trash
after i washed it off i did not notice a huge difference
use it right away
i already have red spots on my face
even though when i washed it off my skin was not red
end results after washing off we're not exciting.
both times my skin felt rough afterwards
i used it on my back where i get acne from working out in a sports bra
used it and woke up with 3 new pimples!
is making me breakout instead of clearing my skin
aside from breaking me out
in the trash this goes!!!
each time i watch my face
leave the dot on all night
i've had better luck with the toothpaste trick.
this atuff works for me when i put it on blemishes three times a day
have my fingers meet without product coming out the top
for that price at least fill up the tube
so applied it on the spot throughout the day -- the pimple turned into a weird under-the-skin bump
it lingered for 2 days even after thorough cleansing
the smell was so overpowering it kept me up at nights
this is more like gentle face wash for mornings not for removing a full face makeup
you're probably going to have use a separate make up remover
to me this is just off putting
i find that i have to use a face wipe beforeh
my face felt fresh after i used this cleanser
i liked the way it cleansed my face
i'll go back to either the cleanser or another product
it does work in taking off your make up
honestly the cleanser works fine to remove make up on its own
the it also balled up under my fingers
but what is up with the scent?!
i think it gave me a big red zit on the side of my cheek
this cleanser removed my water proof make up with ease
it makesmy face looking dirty after i use the tool to take off the product
need to wash my face
beginning to remove the mask
it took forever to remove
after 10 mins or so my face had soaked up all the oil
when the mask is removed you are left with something that feels like a film on your skin
more like a sylicone base after the hour you spend trying to take the mask off
it was a mess to take off.
went through so many tissues to clean off the littlemagnet
took a while for my skin to get back to normal.
rubbed in whatever was left on my skin
i woke up with a full on breakout in different areas of my skin
the "minerals" or whatever is left after the mask comes off are just greasy
immediately put a little on the back of my h
didn't remember to wrap a napkin around the magnet before using it to take off the mask
i found that it took me a long time to apply the mask all over my face
while using the magnet was fun at first it ended up taking a lot longer to remove the mask when it was all done
had to wash it off all right away
it eventually does soak into the skin once massaged
i tried to stick with it
let it sit - felt fine while on.
after getting it all off
i left it on for about 10 mins to see if it would sink it
after you put it on your face
it was weird though because it left an almost watery residue on my face once i removed it
forcing you to clean it
causing a giant frustrating mess
taking it off was so cool to watch.
i rinsed my face right away in fear that i would break out from whatever was left on it
when it comes down to it
went back to my normal skin care
your face is left with some oil
when it comes down to it
i got magnet stuff all over the place.
the bottle is already empty
when you touch your face to redistri
it just comes off
put some toothpaste on you face
stopped using and i cleared up.
the smell lingered on my skin for hours.
this product has a scent that is so strong that it lingers on my face for hours afterwards
i washed my face twice
whatever is left because it leaks all over the place
put this on the shelf
i would stay away from this if you have sensitive skin
now i have to get my skin to clear up!
so the over drying just caused an over production of oil everywhere leaving my face a wreck
every time one starts to go away, i get another.
noticed it was creating a green ring on my counter
i would've kept this cleanser if more thought had gone into the dispensing system
it takes 2-3 times to get my makeup off.
the clear glass bottle did look nice in my shower
just from washing my face twice a day
my skin is slowly going back to normal
an hour after putting it on my face felt tight
luckily it dissipated quickly.
washed it off and tossed it.
went back in with my belif aqua cream instead
i constantly had to reapply because it would dry up within mins of using
i cannot wait to finish it and switch day creams.
especially in the mornings when i wake up after wearing it alone for a night
after about half the bottle i started slapping it on rest of body just to get through it faster
just cover little bits of my red spots
it did not make my red cheeks disappear at all.
it was somewhere in between a cc cream
my make up looked so caked on
it's straight up oompa loompa orange on me.
it just made me orange
moisturizer in order to apply without having it cake up
it was immediately way too dark on my skin
even with primer it slips right off my skin after a few hours
i couldn't find a way to get foundation on over it without one or both products rubbing off
just no staying power on my skin
even if followed with a light foundation
then put powder over
t's time to get out the hammer :
you end up pull the pump off
pounding the bottle to get the rest of it
a lot of product gets left behind with no way to get to it without breaking the bottle
plus the dispenser stops dispensing at around 3/4 empty
it took some effort to rinse it all off
i figured my mom had tried to use it on its own without rinsing with water
i hate double washing my face
however, the smell is a turn-off.
also, it disappears the moment water hits it.
it just goes away
while this does the trick to get rid of make up
followed up with my usual cleanser
literally melts everything off
come to find out, it was this cleanser.
all around my chin area on both sides of the face
when i was done i had raccoon eyes that i still had to use eye makeup remover for
while it did take off all traces of my other makeup off
slip all over my face
my makeup just floated ok my face
my makeup wasn't going on smoothly on top of it
then at times it would pump out thick
then watery again i'm guessing separation in the oil
tried shaking it before use
this completely filled in the lines on the back of my h
there is nothing on the package that says it has to be shaken up before using
when i put on foundation with a beauty blender the product separated
it does help hold up my makeup.
no help with my dark circles
i didn't see a difference in the length or deep of my fine lines
in fact i looked like i had completely stopped applying eye cream all together
i know it won't erase them
how surprised i was to wake up with puffy eyes
should have stuck with that
it was as though i was putting my makeup over bare
was very excited to try it as i have perpetual dark circles under my eyes
no help for fine lines or dark circles at all :(
with high hopes am looking into taking care of my eyes with a winning daily cream
win some, lose some.
after two days of use my under eyes were flaky
then i put on the bye bye concealer
as soon as i put the moisturizer over it the puffs came back
i picked this up in the rewards bazaar
i stopped using it and my skin cleared up.
my neck was sticking together
that was all i could take before i scrubbed it off
my skin has been breaking out on my cheeks
it just sits on my face all day
it just sits there
leaves your face feeling the same way
greasy for the day time
it helps healing big zit that has been popped
giving your skin some down time
i still kept trying
does not take away redness or heal skin the way it describes at all
after only 4 days of use this cream gave me the worst clogged pores all over my cheeks
i wake up in the morning with redness still
takes time for it to fade
after rubbing it into your skin i thought it was enough
it seemed to just take away all the liveliness in my skin
within minutes i was a walking ball of grease
i'll keep using it until i finish the jar
it still looks like i have breakouts when really there is just redness left behind from acne that i have picked at or harshly treated in efforts to rid my face of it
my redness was still alive
i needed an oil on my face
i broke out so bad on my cheeks
the skin on my face felt like it was unable to breathe because of all the product on it
within 10 minutes of applying this i had white heads all over my chin
while this product helped to cover all that up
the product settled into my pores
i felt like i was rubbing foundation on my face
you can tell from a mile away their is a product on your face even if you put a small amount on
also after about 1 hour i look like an oil slick with this
it also showed every single one of my dry spots.
it still left me with a white film on my face
it made my makeup slide around
it left me feeling oily right from when put it on
unfortunately wound up causing me more redness
this balls up on the skin
at the end of the day i washed my face like usual with the oil first then purity
notice new pimples coming up all over my cheeks
i washed my face again still notice the filming stuffs from this cream
i then used the cotton pads to clean my face
saw the sweat sitting o my face due to the matte finish drying my skin out
using it all up it didn't mess up my skin or break me out
i gave it 3 stars because it takes a lot of work to get get rid of all the residue it leaves behind
my cleanser took more makeup off.
my favorite cleansing balm is the one banila co because it literally melts away my makeup
boscia makeup melter melted zero makeup on my face i was pulling at my face the whole time
i ended up using a triple amount of cleanser to remove everything
got as a 100 point perk.
tend to avoid putting more oil on my face so as to avoid break-outs
the wipe still picked up a lot of make-up left.
it seemed to take off all my makeup
very soon i realized it was clogging my pores
it did take the make-up off
although it removed all of my makeup
it did not wash away cleanly
it gets some slip when you add water
i feel the need to wash my face twice more to get rid of the residue
this product effectively takes off all my makeup at the end of the day
long-wear make up
left it feeling smooth afterwards
i still had to use an oil-based makeup remover on my eyes after
use a face wash just to make sure my make up was gone
it felt like my face had a layer of film over it afterwards
after i wash my face with this
all of your makeup is removed
i like to use balm products to take off make up
i am giving away my 3/4 full bottle
if it gets closer to my nose
it seems that i spent oil on the face
putting on a big dollop of this stuff turned my face into an oil slick for the rest of the day
when i wake up in the morning my face still feels moisturized
to top it all off i see no improvement in my skin in any way after 3 weeks of using it religiously
i tried to use it as a neck cream instead
then rubs off if you touch your face
made them break out
broke me out in tiny white zits all over face it was so bad
the only thing that changed in my routine
left my face so greasy
well, this product just rained on my skin parade.
this makes me look like i haven't washed my face in a week
time to wash this crisco off of my face...
i did my daily routine
i just washed it off my face
my skin is broken out again.
unfortunately, my skin started breaking up.
out from the rest
you can pick up shea
mine is going right back to sephora.
it just sits on your face
i tried in the store on my clean face
it comes in a pink liquid with clear that sits at the top
didn't brighten my under eyes
starting to get fine wrinkles around my eyes
it also left a burning sensation.
the skin around my undereyes
it left my skin feeling so heavy
it neither cleared my skin
30 minutes after washing it off
the scent is still lingering on my h
nose areas even after rising off with water a few times
after leaving it on for a few minutes then rubbing my face it all came off in sheets
my day-to-day make up is really light
the cleansing oil just was not up to the task of taking my make up off
i actually went back with a cotton facial pad
to get rid of any left over make up
it was insane how much the cleansing oil missed
especially since i was barely wearing any make up
i picked this up on a whim after hearing all great thing on this br
it leaks all over the place when you put the dropper back into the bottle
i transferred the product into another empty oil container i had lying around
felt heavy on my skin
i decided to leave this on for the day to see how it moisturized my face
i can't imagine going to sleep/ waking up like this every day
it immediately absorved into my skin
ended up with a white mask that was very difficult to blend into my skin
back on the hunt for my holy grail moisturizer.
this makes my face red
wake up at 8am
i couldn't find a middle ground
it goes away pretty fast after applying on my face
your skin will soak up a lot of product.
i like to let it sit on my skin for 10-15 mins.
removes all make-up.
while i found that it did remove all of my makeup
leave my skin clean
my skin is now finally starting to clear up
my skin had miraculously cleared up
my pores were just full of dirt
you can get away with most washes
the appearance is a bit off
the system together does remove my heavy eye make up pretty well though
the oil felt fine on my face
everything else took all my makeup off
my skin felt rejuvenated after washing my face
then wash it clean with the soap
it was tough at cleaning
the set left my skin feeling
gave this product a side eye when i noticed i had to put the oil on my dry face
then use the soap
massage it into my face
i felt with using the oil first it was just too slippery with applying the soap over it
t just hangs out on the edge of my sink
could not get the oil off even after applying the bar soap
i still had to wash my face after with a different cleanser
after i used the bar i see bump on my face so
the bar soap is just messy to have on my counter
i liked using the oil then washing it off.
i threw the oil away and just used the soap.
the cleansing bar left my skin feeling stripped
using the two together really dried out my skin even more
without spilling it everywhere
the travel case wasn't very easy to put down anywhere other than the shower floor
the oil got everywhere
i put the mask on
covered my nose while walking out of my kitchen
back to the hunt for another great eye cream :
i love belif cushion which i use every day
i patted my finger on the top of it
even under my eyes before using my foundation
i also had a few issues with bumps under my eyes while using this stuff
f you're concerned about your money being thrown away in two weeks
my fine lines had turned to creases
went back to my cheap cerave eye cream
this cream gave me bumps around my eye area
it takes off most of my makeup
it makes it streak all over my face.
it arrived with a broken lid as well
i put it on all my dryest places
cracked spot on the corner of my nose
i slather a fine size amount all over my face as soon as i come home in the evening
it was so greasy i had to wipe my h
it left my face
looked in my car mirror i looked so shiny
my whole face was glittery
almost sticky mid way through the day
this just looks like you stood in front of a fire hydrant filled with glitter
when i put it on i looked like i had just rubbed glitter all over my face
there is in practically every highlighter these days
so, i go out to run an errand.
it immediately turns into a disco ball
the smell is unbearable i had to wash it off.
after 30 minutes the smell didn't show any signs of going away
then it broke me out my skin did not get along with this moisturizer
i applied it to my face clean
it removed my makeup
it took me 3 times to fully scrub this off
it literally looked like tinkerbell blew a glitter bomb on face
i will probably just save them as a shoulder highlighter for the summer
i cannot imagine walking around with this on my face
i removed some of it
this has straight up glitter in it
it took two makeup wipes to get it all off my face
even woke up the next morning feeling like my face had a weird sheen to it
it was actually packed with glitter
as soon as i saw myself in the mirror at school i washed my face because i actually looked like a disco ball
when you go under a light bulb or outdoor light it looks like someone through very fine glitter in your face
however i'd only use it when i'm going out for a wild night on the town or add a small amount to my daily moisturizer when i'm going make up less
because of the amount of glitter that it left on my h
wanted to use it as a moisturizer before putting my makeup on
patted the excess product on my forearms because the amount of product in the sample was a bit too much for just the face
then, i went about my usually makeup routine.
this made my face look like a giant snow globe.
okay no harm no foul i was just going to wash it off
i washed my face twice
tried to wipe it all off
i still have glitter everywhere the next day
then go out in daylight
not only is it straight up glitter
put it all over your face
when the light hits my face, it looks ridiculous.
i caught a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror at work
if you step out into the sunlight it looks like a glitter bomb went off in your face
tell me that i had untouched moisturizer on my face- which i didn't
dewy from farther away
up close it just looks like i put glitter on my face
it just set on fine lines instead of providing an even color or even absorbing into the skin
i only have one wrinkle around my eyes
when i wake up in the morning after putting it on at night the skin around my eyes looks smooth
i like to wear my eye cream really close to my lash lines
when i do that with this balm it ends up getting in my eyes
let alone near my eyes
i've always had dark under eye circles
it went on thick for me
right off the bat a few things
i still had creases under my eyes when putting on makeup
it gave an instant blur affect to my under eyes making my concealer set
smells nice until it gets near the bottom.
the rest on my neck daily
i give it two stars because it does not erase or fix fine lines
didn't see a change in my skin outside of hydration
$95 is a lot to spend on an eye cream
i followed up with my deep tissue repair
the lines are back
the bottom line is
the initial scent is off putting to me
had to wash it off because it made my h
works well under make up
overall this product did not blow me away
once you wash this off, the lines are back.
even if i leave it to absorb for up to an hour
think it's time to pack up
which i would happily put up with
had to wash it off right away
it was not my cup of tea
it also left my face very red as it didn't sink into the skin
when i try putting makeup on it
it is nowhere near as hydrating as the sample was
it is also nowhere near as glowy
it pilled up even when i waited at least 5 minutes to apply my foundation
they seemed to clear up right away
it sat on the surface of my skin emphasizing all of the texture on my face
if anything i have to put more moisturizer on before putting my makeup on just to keep my face from peeling
i tried makeup on right after application
it also peeled off my face a lot when worn alone.
i cleaned my face
then i applied my usual foundation
the next night my face cleared up
i tried it again on my bare skin
it left a white film on my face
nothing changed in my skin care routine
would get patchy on the centre of my face
my makeup just melts away
it took forever to absorb into my skin
when i went to do my makeup it made my foundation ball up all over my face
my face felt dirty
also it takes a lot to take off your makeup.
i definitely need to follow up with a double-cleanse or at least a make up remover
i need it for taking off my eye makeup
i do try to cement said eye makeup to my face
it was ok for removing face makeup
the green tea one caused me to breakout.
it did clean my face
still felt i needed another item to completely get rid of all oils off my face
at first i thought it was dead skin balling up off my palms
the only difference i've seen/felt after washing it off was that my skin oils were cleaned away
my face feels clean afterwards
the lid doesn't stay closed very well
my skin wasn't clean after using it twice
at least clean my face
after a minute i rinsed the mask off which came off easy without the mess of the usual masks
i looked them up
or exfoliating- gave me more dead skin to deal with- even with following up with a moisture mask that usually solves all of my issues
the initial application is hard to do while holding your breath
this product went on like a moisturizer instead of a mask
used it on my red face after a long day in the sun
turned to my clarisonic to remove it
this morning i woke up with redness
can smell it hours after i put it on
when i applied it to my face it felt gritty
basically clumped up my makeup
it made the foundation break up
wear away in a messy way
it made all of my foundations break up
made me break out in white heads wherever i had put it on
not on my face or neck
made my makeup stay in tact all day long
didnt glide on smooth i am going back to korres
knock out a few steps in my morning routine
figured i could knock out two steps of my makeup routine
it balls up with my foundation
i give it 3 stars because i'm on the fence
down the side of my face
would roll off on my fingertips
around the corners of the mouth
the flakes return in 20 minutes
even after letting the product soak into my skin
it is coming off of my skin in flakes
area around my mouth was plugged up
the next day i had several pimples pop up on my forehead
i tried this product at night after washing my face
how it sunk into my skin
after 10 minutes my face felt tight
i decided against my usual patch test routine
just keep it in my purse
i will only be using on beach/pool days for the extra sun protection
i like to wear a little eye eye make up every day if i can
but it does help cover up my pores.
i would've wiped all of the product away
almost "balled up/rolled" off when applying my foundation
it made my face look like a dirty mess after a few hours
had to wash it off
i just still wasn't blown away
literally save your money
it wiped my nose make up off
i've gone through almost all of the little bouncy pad in about a month
to carry with me to get rid of that mid-afternoon shine
nothing seems to work to keep the oil at bay
cheap-it completely removed my base make up
my makeup always breaks around my nose
it kept my makeup from breaking
didn't perform better than blotting papers
it’s bigger than any powder/blotting sheets i would bring for touching up
i get the same mattified effect when i blot my face
only left my skin mat for a very short time.
then it left me more shiny than before i put it on
under my setting powder
then patches of my foundation
have gone back to blotting papers
toilet seat covers to get rid of some of the shine on my face
there was a mattefied effect right after i applied my makeup on top of it
when i tried it wiped off my makeup
it removed my makeup
it picks up your foundation
do about 4 masks a week
so much so that i put coconut oil on throughout the day for an entire week to stifle the flakes on my face
i want to try the pep-start hydroblur
i end up looking like a greasy mess
stay away from this product
ended up shiny within 2-3 minutes of application
tight feeling after using this
it made me red
make it part of my routine
1st use after 1 day face looked like fish scales
it worked well for my forehead the very sides of my face
the rest of my face
i will finish the whole jar
the black heads will be loosen up after using this l
black head are still there
left it on for 1/2 hour barely tingled
nothing earth shattering for me.
i tried the swirl for about a week
burning to the point where i had to wash my face asap
any liquid on top of this just sits there n separates n when u swipe it off it just balls up like glue
i went back to the revitalizing black gel.
i debate throwing it out every day
i love the feeling when i just put this on after cleansing my skin
once i applied this it started to make my skin flake everywhere
i wasn't mad at this until i had tiny bumps in the morning
after applying it on my face
when going on your skin
my face freaked out
without leaving me greasy
rest of the bottle is just packaging
applied several drops enough to cover my entire face
get to work from home
as soon as i saw a few on my chin
but the next morning....it just dries up.
while the duo works wonders at overnight
it also left my face feeling greasy
this is coming from someone with normal skin
washed it off within an hour
i initially picked up a sample of this because it literally smells so divine
my skin didn't appear hydrated when i checked it the next morning
have gone through 2 jars
this has made me weary of the cream
just sits on top of my skin
i would wake up with my skin peeling because of how bad this was drying me out
once i started using it i felt like my pores were not breathing
it doesn't let my foundation sink into my skin for a flawless finish
not giving up on this br
i barely got breakout before with any moisturizer
this one might be the reason i have breakout on my chin
maybe use it for my feet instead???
i tried letting it sit for 5 minutes to absorb
i looked like a splintered disco ball.
i tried keeping it to night time wear
it feels like it weighs down my face
instead i wear it during the day
the smell is over the top.
it didn't irritate my skin as long as i stay away from my eyes
i always have to follow up with other cleansers just to remove makeup
let everything calm down
i would wash my face with this
within 20 minutes there is lots of oil on my nose
on the flip side
i got this cleanser to use as the second step after using a cleansing oil
i find myself using all of my face cleanser samples instead of this
got some in my eyes
i accidentally got soap in my eye while washing my face the other night
i could barely see out of the eye for the next hour as a thick soap residue occasionally came out of my eye
i give it two stars because it did clean
at the same time remove my makeup
along my chin after using it
the only upside was that there was no feeling of having a film on my face after washing
i suggest if you have combination skin to stay away from this
the bumps went away
this face wash did not help keep by pores clear or reduce the amount of white heads on face
however it completely dried out my skin to the point where my entire face felt scaly
heavy duty moisturizer in the few days i was using the face wash
left my skin feeling stripped
the winter months take their toll on my skin
turned into a nightmare for me
it resulted in permanent scaring around the corners of my mouth
after i put it on my face
i found my skin start to turn red
cheeks after just 4 nights use
on the plus side
it kind of "sits" on my skin
this cream caused me to break out like crazy.
stopped using it and my skin cleared up.
it caused my skin to break out
my skin is still recovering
if you're thinking about spending $200 in hopes of lightening your dark eye circles
i look like i'm burned
i rinsed it off right away
it did mess up my chin badly
it does fill in pores without breaking me out
patted over foundation like suggested wherever shine is a concern
the product would ball up on my skin when used as a primer
it dries nearly immediately after you apply it
the product starts rolling on your skin
this kept my make up looking matte for about 4 hours
my foundation is falling off
sometimes it would ball up
it kind of balled up on my face
as i rubbed it in it kind of balled up in my face
oil away all day
i got endless bumps all over my face.
was washing that off
right off the bat, i had some issues with this.
the ones that separate the product from the inside of the jar lid
circles or fine lines
is i will first cleanse my face
it starts to ball up when you touch your skin
there was no straw connected to the pump
ing upright without having to smack it every time
eventually gave up bc it pills under makeup
their regular squalane oil both broke me out overnight
woke up with 3 red pimples :
if only it took off all of my eye makeup.
this made me look like a high schooler again
doesn't weigh down the fine skin around the eye
don't plan on putting makeup on right away.
can use the rest of my routine on them
this cleanser also had 0 effect on clearing up my acne
feeling it leaves on my face
because the smell is right up my alley
then applying it to the face
out of the rest of the olehenriksen oil control products
after a week i noticed white heads showing up all over my face
would switch off with my regular cleanser
it works just fine
this has quickly become my new go to cleanser in the mornings especially when i really need a invigorating wake up call
then throughout the day it turns into an oily mess
it's separating my foundation
i read somewhere that aha's sit on top of the skin
only had to use one oil sheet to blot vs two
ball up on the skin
i ended up having to wash it off
this can ball up if you rub too much when it dries up
t takes a lot to keep me shine free all day
i may move to only using this after my nighttime routine when i don't have to worry about a bit of afternoon shine
every once in awhile when you first pump it out it squirts out kind of hard causing it to go on my h
almost has a powder feel to the face after applied
however my face was still oily at the end of the day
for me i still needed to blot throughout the day
though it helped keep my oils at bay
i find the corners of my mouth
toner which definitely took away all my oil however the moisturizer added a little something back
i tried it on just washed face
except make me break out like a teenager right before my best friend's wedding
trying it on your neck in case you too break out
on top of that if it gets into your eyes
it even made my eyes red.
my eyes immediately begin to water
i actually have to rub some off to relieve the watering
some fine lines around my eyes
it does plump up the skin after application
little second lid are kind of messy
it does not soak into or lay on your skin nicely.
ended up emphasizing my pores
it seems to just sit on top of my skin without absorbing
ended up washing everything off
this gel started breaking out my skin in little bumps
even after switching off the br
it took awhile to get it all cleared up
stops working for a bit
i woke up to some peeling skin between my eyes
this just felt heavy
after finally biting the bullet
left it feeling a little on the greasy side
i think i'll go back to vinoperfect radiance instead
i ended up squeezing the tube about halfway before having any of the eye cream getting dispensed
kind of sits on top of my skin
it separates in the tube so you have to shake it up before you use it
my make up was super "dewy" that day
the product sits on top of my skin
felt like straight up oil
now it feels like i'm putting cooking oil on my face
ended up only using it for my lips
to add both to my morning
the product was kept in an upright position the entire time
basically disappeared on my skin
the day after using this product i woke up looking like i rubbed dirt all over my face
it ruined my face
my entire face was red
i saw people using it to bring their brow pomades back to life
with all of the hype surrounding this on instagram from lip gurus
when i put this on my face
this product is the worstit's basically like putting olive oil on your face
if anything it just sits on top of the skin
nterested in trying it out on my face
after i put my makeup on
i could literally feel my makeup just sitting on top of the oil
it just sits on top off the skin
put your hard earned money towards a br
it did broke me out so bad so right now i have pimples on my cheeks bones area
this just made my face break out
after a little while it seemed as my make up was melting off
after using it for two days dried out the skin around my eyes
the smell goes away in 2 weeks
my entire chin area broke out badly
instead it made my foundation patchy
i follow her on instagram
aside from these minor pros
ended up tossing it in the trash
then i got a lot of tiny red bumps
it grabs all your makeup
has helped banish some of my millia
tested it on the back of our h
the next day i immediately used it as a primer as it says to- i was a greaseball 30 mins after putting my makeup on
the foundation around my nose was literally melting off
wearing it as the first step of my skin care routine before my make up
every which way i tried just makes everything melt off my face
my face not looking greasy for a couple of hours
at the end of the day after wearing this under my makeup i noticed a huge pimple on my cheek
the smell also stays all day.
felt this sticky feeling on my face even after a couple of hours
i looked up the ingredients
this product has been shoved down our throats by every major influencer
my makeup kind of just melted off.
woke up with it all stuck to my face
put some on my chest as a bit of a body splash
my skin was on the mend
this took off my face makeup easily
the makeup it left behind
picking it up at a local shop
made my foundation slip
t leaves an almost powder film on my face
just sits on top of my skin
my face has broken out
could be worn easily under make up
foundation sit on top of it
sits on top of my skin
took awhile to actually absorb into my skin
that just puts a rotten cherry on top.
it stays on top
now onto the scent
it takes 5 pumps to clean my face
i enjoy the way it cleans my make up
t just covered up the black spots n made it look like they were gone
when i deep cleaned my pores like i always do every night they showed up again n that white cast just washed off
the blackheads disappeared right after the mask can off
cheek area for my entire life
have had deep set in black heads for as long as i remember
i just cannot shake them
you barely get a drop
i used a whole mini jar on my face and neck.
shame on you (gives sephora the middle finger)
it still felt sticky the next day.
it leaves a film that balls up
it was a nice concept to place a rubber film on my face
place on my face
i saw this mask at sephora while shopping for other stuff
the picture completely caught my attention
apply without tearing it
oil that i was trying to rid of
it constantly rolled up on the sides
for $17cad i waited until the sephora vib rouge 15% off sale to pick it up
just a warning: be super carful removing it from the package
it hung off my nose super bad
went way past my hair line
it also went almost up to my ears
had to lay down while using it to get it to not fall off
the rubber mask was so flimsy that if you barely pulled it would break apart
after removing the mask my skin did feel tighter
didn't absorb into my skin after 40 minutes
however after i rubbed what i could in
the rubber mask came in two pieces which was fine
terrible camera angle ahead!
is placed on the face like a sheet mask
kinda steep price for just one mask
the mask ripped very easily
it would just dig into the mask which was my fault
it kept falling everywhere
rubbed in the remaining product after 40 minutes
it kept sliding around
the rubber part of the mask is a well thought idea to keep all the product in place
just kinda sits on top
i got small bumps all over my face not to mention a nasty pimple by my chin that i'm still working to get rid of after weeks
for me it's no more than wiping water on my face
and it made my skin break out.
stopped using it for awhile until my face cleared up
my skin went back to how it regularly is
if you're on a tight budget
yet my entire face was a grease bomb
this broke me out so bad with little bumps all over my cheeks
it took forever to go away :
it was for a couple days then i realized these funky little bumps showing up all over my face
felt just light swiping water on my skin.
before i used this my skin was perfectly fine!
have literally tried everything on my face
in fact, i think it made my face shiner.
as you rub it in it breaks down into a water consistency
oh well, sending back.
very quickly goes away
the fresh start eye cream
woke up with even more break outs
it did temporarily give my face a glow though.
when i washed it off my face
in the fading of my dark spots
when i started using this there was is clear liquid that separated from the cream
then the cream stuck to the edges of the bottle.
i keep my eyes closed really tight
it just rolled off of my skin
luckily the directions say to put on before your moisturizer
started breaking out all over my forehead
my blackheads were back the next day
both times my eyes burned from the pine scent therefore i will be exchanging it
stings when going on.
i started getting acne around my eyes
just in the area where i put this cream
the entire area around my eyes is now peeling
or dark circles under my eyes
reverse the very fine lines i am getting under my eyes
it kind of just slides around
worst of all it turned very foul-smelling in just a few months
i am a huge fan of the entire drunk elephant line- i swear by every other product they make
hope those dots go away..
product gave me acne all around my eyes within 2 days of use
i do however love the rest of the drunk elephant line
after washing this off it left a film on my skin
i spend more time removing the bubbles off of my face
the product will leak if you put it straight up
took me a long time to clean the shelf where i put this product
itself that is breaking me out because i use this as a morning cleanser
it leaves your face clean after the second wash
i shut my cleanser good
i put it laying down, i put it standing up.
i love this cleanser as the second wash in my double cleansing routine
i lost half a bottle from it seeping in my shower
i've gone back to the juju
my skin is finally going back to normal after the chaos this cause me
every time i used this i would wake up in the morning with small white heads that would turn into breakouts
barely washed off my make up
every other product i have tried from drunk elephant quickly made a huge difference in the condition of my skin
those issues cleared up the next day
if you stand the tube up on end, it will leak.
i won't complain about the twister cap.
it removed all my makeup
this is a bit of a departure from the drunk elephant cleansing bars
however, it left me running for the moisturizer.
it left my skin right tight and irritated.
the suds take forever to wash off
almost like i still have residue on my face from the cleanser
it just squeezes out of the bottom
lip make-up then went back in
then close the tube without making a bit of a mess given how liquid the product is
this cleanser falls very flat for me
the directions say it will remove eye makeup
the cap is a twist to open it
so the product just dispenses out on the lid
every use so that when you dispense the next time you are putting the product on a clean surface
you twist the lid to open
the cleanser has leaked all over the place
it works nicely to remove make-up
my face felt clean after
i noticed a lot of small bumps pop up around my face
including under my eyes
which i'm assuming was caused by the build up of bacteria on the stick
together they fixed my dull skin
they were in my hair
instead they get everywhere.
stick to your face even after washing.
i would find them stuck to my neck
i wouldn't use this for using in a make up cleaning routine either
it barely takes any make up off your skin
around my mouth would form
my face felt so clean afterwards
it cleaned up my black heads like i've never seen that clean
wow what a rip off!!
like the container is empty
i see people keep saying it took away redness.
overall the mask took away a lot of oil from my skin
never sets so you have to set a timer to know when to remove it
when i dried off my face pores were tightened
my face was so smooth
then soaping it up in my h
i finish washing my face
has a tack to it after using this
its disappearing on its own
it was hard to remove makeup with it
it does clean well without leaving my face feeling stripped
i would leave it in a bag after i patted it dry
it seems to be disappearing before my eyes!
the "storage container" it arrives in simply lets dirty water pool around the bottom half of the ball
it doesn't close and leaks all over the place.
that's almost $3 per face wash
i don't like how it just sits in the plastic bottom after using it
it takes time for the ball to form foam on the face
sits on top of the skin
my skin immediately cleared up
it took forever to absorb
i kept waking up with tiny little zits with a few scattered monstrous ones
i did my regular nightly ritual
am i the only person who isn't blown away by this?
literally see no difference in my skin
i literally tried hunting this down at every sephora location in the la area
it even caused a red patch on my cheek which then turned into a dry patch the next day
save your money ladies
i noticed when i use this as a sleep mask
the box gives two options: to use as a sleeping mask
i got a pimple in the middle of my eyes on my nose
gets all in your hair while you sleep
the brightening of scars was the main driving point in purchasing the essence so fingers crossed
my skin was back to its usual self
the next morning i woke up with skin so tight that my eyes appeared distorted
after loving the watermelon sleeping mask i was hoping this would be my new cleanser
i got this to use as a second cleanse
it caused me to break out in small bumps
my skin started developing some deep pimples under the skin as soon as i started using this
it broke my skin out and irritated my checks.
still hasn't gone away
i quickly went back to my old firming serum from philosophy
now it makes my skin break out
but then the smell goes away quickly.
i could barely stand to put it on my face.
i actually ended up starting to notice very dominant hairs on my chin that were never there before i started using this stuff
all the scars i ended up getting from scratching at my face
like baby throw up
on the plus side though
i threw this sample out due to it leaving red blotches on my skin the day after that also had a burning sensation
gave it three stars because it kept my face hydrated throughout the night
my skin soaks it up literally instantly to the point where it feels just like another average moisturizer
this made my entire face so dry it ended up peeling
i recommend you to put it into a refrigerator before use
it comes in giant tubs in tubes for a few bucks.
i'll probably use it for body cream just to use it up
it sat on my face and made it sticky all day.
sitting on only half of my face
after putting it on
if i put it on after i take off my makeup
like i spent the whole night sweating
the more i break out in a patch by my nose
it ruined my face for 3 days
my face has cleared up
i tried it out along with the eye cream
i've tried a lot of face masks before
then i woke up to all these tiny red pimples on my face
same as when i put the mask on
the rest of my skin however was glowy
i wasn't blown away
left it for 15 mins
my entire face was red.
i woke up to zits
it went on nicely, and washed off easily.
once i washed it off my skin looked exactly the same
this one is a complete let down
after i washed it off
my skin started to break out like crazy
try to wipe it off
you got some dirt on your face
is okay after a while
gives my face a smooth finish
the thing that made me return it is that it settled in my pores around my nose
settled into my pores
so when my breakouts clear up
after washing my face in the shower
it says to continue your regular skin routine afterwards
it also took awhile to absorb into the skin.
i still felt like it was sitting on top of my skin instead of being absorbed for a very long time
i almost wonder if it wiped off in my sleep on my pillow
it took a while to get my skin back to normal -- i love serums
i cracked open the first plastic foil packet
i used it nightly, right before going to bed.
it may have broken me out on my chin a bit
or even my right smile line go away
my eyes began to sting despite not placing the product too close to my eyes
it made me look like a walking stick or
sit on top of my skin
overall the level of greasyness was a turn off making me want to instantly cleanse my face
at the end of day 3 my face look like a teenager going through puberty
losing credibility with me...
applied it on with a q-tips just enough to cover the trouble spots before bed
the spots feels a little tingling after putting it on
after my nighttime face routine
at this point time was healing my face .
red spots all over my face
then i switched to a different eye cream
i started to notice that my skin was feeling fresh
i swear by aha's to keep my skin clear
there have been a few times after applying my facial oil that the pilling was so bad i had to rewash my entire face
this stuff just pills right off
the ingredient table had completely changed.
it sits just fine
it stays on overnight
instead of having to rub it off.
got to build up to this like retin a.
the texture was just uncomfortable on my face
many times i put this moisturizer on it stung my face
i kept switching foundations thinking that was the problem
the facial water that was part of the kit squirts out in a narrow area rather than mist so this is going back to sephora
i spread just a little across my face
on the flip-side
it caused me to break out with a lot of pimples
i still have the jar
get a bunch of spots on my cheek area
it broke me out all over my forehead
when applying to my face
i tried to get over the scent
ill use the rest of the tube
then someone asked me if i was sunburned
had it not broken me out i might have stuck with it just for the smell alone
it was like it stripped away at my skin.
still have my fingers crossed!
my face looks clean afterwards
i wash my face at night
fresh after i wash it
it just stripped my skin
i only bought this because the on the go cloths are the perfect balance of clean
it feels like it sits on top of the skin
it just dries on top of the skin
every once in a while it leans toward drying
f you rub your face it starts to roll up
nothing else changed in my routine except adding this moisturizer- zits came back
tried it as a night cream along with my usual serums
i'd wake up my face would be so greasy that it left marks all over my pillow
i noticed my makeup dragged on my face instead of being smooth
after about 30 mins of wearing it
like it just sits on top of the skin rather than sinking in
it left almost a greasy
when put your makeup on
after it dried it started peeling off my face
sink into my skin
just "right on top
even after it sinks into your skin
having to blot every hour
i tried wearing it under makeup
ended up using another moisturizer over it
i avoid them all together
whamalamadingdongs without causing my skin to flare up
breaking out in little bumps
this pills up so badly
i still use it at night in my neck
what to give my skin a rest
after just 1 wk of consistent every night i woke up w such an oily face
i went through 2x my blotting papers
instead it gave me red bumps
woke up to the bumps
will be returning right away.
it balled up on my face
immediately right after my skin feels tight
in the morning i got three white heads on my chin :
tried to wash it off
still ended up covered in white bumps
is now breaking me out
the foundation was crumbling up on my face
broke me out with bumps on my face!!!
felt sticky almost the whole time
had high hopes as i'm still trying to find that miracle product to help fade my acne scars
apply a moisturizer/make up routine about 30 mins later
even when going make-up free it peels off
i would start picking up some kind of flaky things as if my face was peeling
then when i put on my primer it's just starts peeling
still on the hunt.......
then a cream for face it becomes like lizard's skin
my skin cleared up
i wake up every morning looking like i just left the gym
started developing so many white heads all around my cheek
i am also now breaking out on top of the heavy flow of extra oil
after applying it to my face
my skin cleared up
my skin started clearing
just checked the ingredients
stay away if comedenics concern you
it sat as a grease pool on my face
in still recovering from the damage
my makeup would not stay on my face after using this as a moisturizer
my makeup was all over my h
on the plus side
okay for around the house or at night
i wouldn't think of wearing it under foundation or eye shadow
it sits on top of the skin
i am starting to show wrinkles around my mouth area
primer for my make up
tacky to touch even after hours of application it is very different as i had put it on in in the morning
i still feel the wax on my face 4 hours later
even then i wake up
couldn't get it off my finger fast enough no way i'd put that on my face
it takes a lot of warming up in your h
had to dig my fingers through
just washed it off
i could barely sleep because of the smell
i literally threw up after putting this on my face
& foundation ended up looking chalky.
the next day i had at least a hundred clogged pores on my face all over my forehead
the sides of my face
acne-prone area of your face for a week or so before committing to your whole precious face
i got a headache from the smell.
leaving my face suffocated
if i left it on my face
the water in the cream had separated
i kept waking up with clogged pores
breaks with one fall
sits on top of your skin
now i'm using my jar up on my legs because i don't want it to go to waste
had to wash it off
return it right away
it went away completely only after two hard scrubs of face wash
couldn't get over it so just threw the jar away.
just take that junk out.
will use on my feet until it runs out.
it has a foil seal which i have not removed before
i still want to heave every time my h
s get close to my face
the scent is so strong it burns my eyes just being close to them
if i apply it anywhere in the center of my face the fumes burn my eyes
it feels like it sits on my face
seemed to have dried it out even though it stays looking wet on my face until i wipe off or continue with my makeup routine
washed it off because it was unbearable
the moment i applied it to my face
then have to wash it off
so returned to a new jar of hope in a jar
i got this along with the philosophy cleanser
proceeded to wash off my face
the smell is literally making me ill
i then use the left for my legs
after putting it on
my skin would just drink it up
instead of tossing the jar
i now use it on my neck
had to scrub it off my face
my face is super oily by the end of my 8 hour shift
it would go on fine then make my skin look super dry
their make-up wipes
i decided to use the entire jar before judging
it left my face rough
put my face oil aside to see what this can do
it is hard to pass off the smell
acnes started to popped out around my cheek.
there are some left
had to wash it off
my skin started to clear up
the lid will not screw back on
it completely clears my skin overnight
i stuck to it for a long time
the first 2 weeks my skin purged like crazy
your skin will rip off
my face is already clearing up
when i stopped using it my skin looked better the acne was even clearing up
finally 3 of them are starting to go away not before leaving some scaring
also putting it on my under eye area
my eyes will water at the corners
fine lines started to appear
i've bought very high end eye creams before that lasted me up to a year so that's the only part that bothered me
it turns out to be a nightmare
this stuff balled up like crazy
ice on your face for the same effect
it does brighten up
after using this it was really uncomfortable closing
just a normal eye gel for summer.
just a regular eye cream
the middle is empty for i'm not sure what reason.
let alone helping with morning puffyness in the under eye area
it actually made the dark circles under my eyes st
i now use it as my night eye cream
lesson the circles under my eyes
not directly below my eyes or right on top of my eyelids
it does create a tight feeling around the eye
on the search for my ddf erase eye gel
overall i love everything in the fresh line
actually ended up clogging my pores
i will use this jar up
go back to using the bar version
i put it on in the morning after i washed my face
let it sit for about 5 minutes before rinsing off
i like this mask to use once in a while to clear my pores
it's good for a pore clearing mask once a week
it can be a bit messy if using outside of the shower
sticking with the bar version
it caused my face to break out.
my face is left a little greasy
i love their face wash
it actually made my skin break out
this cleansing milk broke me out.
like i'm just putting water
using it at night after oil cleansing left my skin feeling tight
have to use a wipe afterward to get all the eye make-up off
i find after using this product to clean my face
even though it left a residue
all of my make up was on my towel
at least my face felt clean.
when i came home from school they had spread through the day to cover most of my face in larger patches
there was still a film left on my skin after rinsing my face
after using it followed by the toner my face has still a lot of make up on
it does not clean off make up
after you have removed your make-up
or keep it in my shower
use in the morning when i don't have make up on to remove
a make-up remover after using this first
my face immediately burned
it barely takes off any makeup from the face.
it also drys up so the milk is still on your skin
after my face started burning
that would remove make-up
removing eye make up is one of my main concerns
in the end i was still left with some residue on my eyes that wouldn't wash away
it felt like i was trying to wash oil off of my face when using this product
i feel there's makeup left on my skin even after wiping my face five times
it does not wash away with water like the old one did
doesnt take make up easy
does not leave my face clean
it feels like it is still on my face after rinsing it off several times
it leaves a film on my face.
i wash my face in the shower
keeping my fingers crossed that i find something more similar to the old product
unless they bring back the gentle cleanser
happened with their cleansing wash too.
it took me a long time to find a fab cleanser.
yes, my face was clean.
even if i go over my face with a makeup remover prior to using this product
usually end up washing this cleanser off with another one
does not remove make up or even just residual residue after i've already removed the make up with another cleanser
it felt exactly the same as if i'd washed my face with your garden variety
it also stripped away every bit of moisture from my skin
when i wear make up
a little bit of the loose powder foundation to set it
it just isn't helping me fight off the awful acne that's slowly returning
i tried this as my summer cleanser since all my makeup artist friends tell me to stay away from gel cleansers due to their intense drying properties
caused me to break out with small pimples all over my face
i kept it up for a solid month to give my sensitive skin a chance to settle down
after switching back to my fresh cleanser
especially eye make up
this made my face itch all over
i got it in a set with the sensitive/normal foreo christmas set
wash my face 2x a day
it has never cleared up a pimple overnight
have tried every spot treatment out there
i tried this everyday for two months--it made no difference with my blemishes near my chin
it did get rid of a trouble spot on the tip of my nose that i've been struggling with for two years
once i cut open the applicator tip
keep your face clean
i think i picked this up to give my skin a break from the salicylic acid in the origins spot treatment
the application is a weird pen that you need to twist the bottom to release the contents
just put it on the tip of my finger
i washed it off immediately
instead of giving my under eyes hydration
i tried waiting for an hour before i rubbed my eyes
i just needed eye drops or something
as soon as i stopped using this eye cream all of my issues disappeared
am trying to prevent wrinkles early one
another star because it does not burn if you accidentally get it too close to your eyeball
this under eye cream is ok.
it helped smooth a few fine lines
crows feet still there.
will wait for the tube to finish
i like to use eye creams pretty close to my eyes
just stick to application around eyes
crows feet area at the closest to the eye
it was too greasy around the eyes
the fine lines would start to creep back
this made a huge pimple under my eye the next morning
sometimes gave me a stinging sensation
the cream gives my under eyes
it sinks in quickly and is good for day wear.
i will be going back to the black pine cream.
it never absorbed into my skin all the way
ended up returning it for another more light weight moisturizer
this moisturizer caused me to break out after one use
i broke out in tiny little whiteheads all over
especially around my mouth
ended up being too greasy for my combination skin
when i woke up i noticed my skin was completely hydrated
i wasn't blown away with this product
i actually felt it drying my skin out while it sat on the surface of my skin
i just wanted a clenser to remove everything without the extra steps to save time
even after washing my face as directed
i literally woke up with other ten pimples one morning
in fact, i ended up getting three huge pimples.
it took me multiple washes to get rid of my makeup
my towel still had orange all over it once i patted my face dry
decided to use them on a trip to remove makeup
forehead feel so tight after a shower that i had to use twice the amount of argan oil afterwards to balance out
to the point of feeling tight
my friends with normal skin like it
the smell on this one is off-putting.
my skin tone evening out a little
i failed to check the label before picking this up
spent a week slathering my face with this twice a day
pulls makeup away like a charm
left it feeling stripped
if i wash my face with my makeup still on
how clean it looked
i still needed to use an eye makeup remover after i washed my face with this
i will say it is the 2nd face wash that doesnt burn my eyes
it left plenty of makeup on my face
t's not like it had to take off layers of foundation
i did try to clean my brushes
i would use it in the shower to clean my face
the extra on my h
this is after i use a makeup removing wipe on my face
after using this cleanser my face still felt dirty
every day my facial break out was getting worse
my face cleared up
decided to use it only on one of my cheeks
look refreshed when i wake up in the morning
it instantly turned me red
when i apply it after washing my face
looked like i had dried skin pockets on different parts of my face
my face began to get little red bumps around the eyes
made me break out with a pimple so large that i had to see a dermatologist to get a injection to shrink it
am stuck with this garbage
it does cause some peeling around my nose if i use it there twice a day
use powder to cover up
than a red face all day
i put this stuff on my nose at night
walked into sephora to buy a moisturizer that would fix my dry patches
getting myself some makeup now that my skin is back to normal
is just as red as before
treated before wasting your money on what this ended up being was an expensive moisturizer
have had blemish free skin forever
this stuff has calmed
i only use it on my left eye
to also lighten the area under my eyes
works well under make-up
it did tingle when i put it on the underneath of my eyes
then as the day wears on
over my eye when i use
left my face calm
you can put it on in the shower
if you do it outside of the shower it will make a mess
after a few uses my bar has just continued to crumble into little pieces
after spending $40 it's sad that this bar has just crumbled into tiny hard to use pieces
you either have to rub the bar on your face while wet
it still is just a big clay mess all over my tub
i already took it out of my facial routine
it felt like it was soaking up all the oil
it practically fell apart from the moisture
ended up becoming a big pile of clay in the bottom of my tub
thought somebody had pooped in the tub
don't leave it in the shower
my acne got cleared out right after stopped using this clay
or i end up with little pieces
left a tight tug to my skin
defiantly didn't meet my expectations
this made me break out with tiny dots
the clay just runs everywhere
i ended up with a muddy mess in my tub
over just to get some of the product onto my face
slides off my fingers a lot of the time before i can get it on my face so then i end up needing more
just try to hold my breathe
just slips around/off my face
1st time i tried this only around the eye area to remove make up
woke up the next day with redness and bumps.
it slips right off my face
now my skin is back to normal
i just got done getting rid of a break out before using this
it wasn't helping out at all now i'm back to square one trying to get rid of another bad break out
i woke up with a couple pimples :/
my face is clean after
i wasn't blown away by it
it started to clog my sink up
have to wash my face again
it stays in the under eye area
get acne from time to time
i applied it as instructed on my clean face.
after washing the mask off of my face
then applying it in your face
this is not fore me!
nothing made the stain go away
after washing off my face was red for 4 days
how smooth it leaves my skin for hours after use
i've had trouble with other face washes being too harsh
i washed my face twice in a row
s onto the face about 4-5 times
make my skin makeup ready
meaning the directions inside the box state that the product cannot be rubbed on the face
you have to pat your face several time
that didn't stay long with the heat outside
my face quickly went back to the greasy shortening feeling
i still feel sticky 30 min later
really press into the skin
stay away if you hate strong fragrances
sticky my foundation was so hard to put on my brush kept catching
my foundation still looked off
it just ended up ruining my skin for at least a week
just sits on the top
by 5pm my face looks like an oil slick
after you apply it to your face try washing it off your h
returned to my usual stuff
the oil was way out of control within an hour or so after i put my makeup on
could keep wearing it
just made my face look like a clown that got its makeup melted off
i put it on in the morning under makeup
put it on for a day around the house with no makeup
greasy at the same time
i could still see the glow come through despite the fact that my routine general goes: moisturizer
nose are working overtime to produce oil leaving them very oilily
made my skin break out
just isnt the right place for it.
almost like a lip balm that it is hard to get out of the container
once its is out it does kind of melt onto the face
then sort of like a wax it just sits there on top of my face instead of absorbing in
then within 20 minutes my nose was shiny
skip on this one
caused my foundation to sit on top of the skin
did this ever ramp that up
to the point where i rubbed the back of my h
i used my sample 2 times under my foundation to my horror my make up looked like it was running off my face
felt heavy after 5 hours of having it on makeup-free skin
basically had to blot 6* during a 12hour day instead of the usual 2*
by the end of the day my makeup
oil still breaks up around my nose
my nails dig into it every time
did keep my face matte for like 2 hours
then goes back to oily
in the mornings after i wake up
unfortunately after just 2 uses i've noticed the pores on my nose
hasn't broken out at all
scars to go along with it
i probably will just throw the rest of the sample away
this was okay for nighttime
when i discontinued use they went away slowly
can't give you guys 5 because my birthday gift was almost empty
on the 3rd day i woke up with so many breakouts all over my chin
do i think it took all the junk off of my face?
i put it on my face, and had no lather at all.
when i went to wash it off my face
my eyes were burning like crazy
look at my under-eye profile in a mirror
you will be much better off sitting up in bed with an ice-cold washcloth over your eye area
i've started noticing that i need to address my under eye bag issue
turned the skin under my eyes red
gives the sensation of opening yours eyes
cool down my eyes when i apply it
however my eyes look just as puffy today after using it
line reduction around my eyes
sephora took it back without any hassle
immediately remember why i love the extra firming eye cream instead
i end up putting another eye hydrator on top of it
which it can do if you have some dead skin cells hanging there
you smooth/ swipe this over your skin
dab/press it onto my face like i would a face oil
did not tighten -- just sat kind of gummy on my face
i may have applied this incorrectly as i patted it into my skin instead of using a sweeping motion
i wanted something that would brighten up my face
it will go away for a min
my skin is back to normal
or tightened my face
then patted this onto my face
setting almost like a mask
so rubbing other stuff on top
just turns me away.
maybe i need to turn down the lights.
i like just rubbing it on and go.
it was just a regular cleanser to me .
this cleanser was great at striping away make up
i even try to avoid my eyes
i will use up the bottle
it burned so bad i had to immediately rinse it off
don't get this near your eyes
cheek area for as long as i can remember
i wash my face twice a day
eventually went up to 3-4 pumps for each wash
it make my eyes sting every single time
while it does clean
my face was clean
are just concealed under the skin making little bumps
if used every day it dries my face out
it was burning throughout the day
it did wash my face
after using this product for about a week i began getting really dry around my nose
i love the way it cleans my face.
it gets rid of all make-up
unfortunately they cut back the size from 8
after a few days of use i realized the cleanser was causing my lips to chap
contemplating returning it because it does moisturize my face
still had pimples popping up
cause my skin to break out
the jar is empty
plus it made me break out
don't waste your money on this product along with the rest of pore no more line
i applied this product to my entire face every night for one month to minimize the oil on my skin throughout the day
as you start massaging them into your skin the product starts balling up
crumbling off of your face
some ingredient is so strong that in the morning i would wake up with both eyes irritated
the only good thing about this product is that it did calm down the redness
why buy this product when i could put any moisturizer in the freezer for half an hour
it also left a sticky feeling all over.
comes in a regular squeeze tube with screw off cap
ing straight up to get out all the product
the container is so huge that it ends up expiring
have not strayed from any other part of my skin routine- clarisonic
the mostly dried cream started balling up on my face
all evening it's been balling up on my face
only after the greasyness goes away
it stings for a good 20 minutes after i apply it
never was absorbed into skin
it also "pills" on my face.
i am going to try their night resurgence cream when this bottle is empty
i felt this moisturizer sitting on my face all day
it was weird when im laying down
also made my skin break out
every time it stung my eyes
normally i don't need to touch up my t-zone until around 2pm
decided to just try this one looked like a grease ball
my face freaked out on me will return
my make up held out very well over it
this literally looks like you just applied straight grease to your face instantly
sun screen you buy on the beach from the tiki bar when you realize you're turning into a lobster
my makeup begins to slide all over my face
started to notice little white heads
because i love their face wash
break outs started going away
i smelled like a day at the pool all day long
even under matte finish foundation
after about 2 hours my face looks greasy
each time i ended up with whiteheads
when i touch my face the product just rolls off.
it just flakes off with the foundation.
by lunch i had to wash my face to get rid of the smell
i don't want to go around smelling my own face all day
my face gets greasy as the day goes on
would love to see some dark spots fade
i'll say up front that this is my first venture into pricey cleansers
like i just rubbed crisco all over it.
hopefully it will work with erasing wrinkles
something to aid with fine lines
i've had this eye cream for a while now
it didn't help with the fine lines that have started to appear under my eyes
it'll sting my eyes to the point of crying
the next day the pimple just popping out one by one
i find it sits on my eyes
then it pools in the little creases under my eyes
when i wash my face after
now it simply had a layer of dried moisturizer on top
which fixed the problem in 4 days flat
i wanted to minimize he dark circles forming under my eyes
it works just fine
got this eye cream as a suggestion from one of sephora's beauty specialists
apparently they use this cream under make up at the beauty studio
this product balled up on my face
have inherited a pair of deep wrinkles below each eye
was hoping for more help with the wrinkles around my eyes
great for perking up tired eyes
i felt like i was putting hair gel on my face.
am starting to get fine lines
get my behind to sephora, trails blazing!
this didn't help with my dark under eye circles at all as other eye creams have
have fine lines starting to form under my eyes
spead it under both eyes
it burns my eyes if i get to close to my eyeballs
with just the right amount
bags under my eyes
to top it all off i go into sephora to pick up a bottle to send to my mom
i actually had to put neosporin under my eyes one night because this was burning the deep crease i now have under my eyes from the area being so dry
tear up every time i used it
now the skin around my eyes is irritated
then become oily in others over the day
ended up returning it to try the new dermologica line "clean start"
i wasn't blown away.
all i got a was a sticky mess sitting on my face
my skin looked exactly the same after i washed it off
smooth after i wash it off
my skin was fine
bought it right away
its hard to rinse off
soft for a short period after i wash it off
when i wash it off my skin is very red
but no results on the wrinkle front!
when you first put this on it is thick
after about 10 min it like melts on your face
i get a white head from time to time
need to re-apply moisturizer during the middle of the day
after one use my face broke out in big fat pimples
it was a fine eye cream
it suddenly broke me out with little bumps
irritated my eyes at night
even when i try to warm it up on my fingertip it pulls at my skin when i try to apply it
thought it would work right away
made me tear right from the start
jacked up the price
it dissapeared into my skin
makes my eyes water every time i put it on
by the end of the day my eyes just hurt
works really well when used before putting on my under eye concealer
i am starting to get fine wrinkles under my eye
it creeps into my eyes
that feeling stays on all day
i will keep trying more eye creams out
the moisturizer started crumbling off my face
the foundation ends up crumbling
my face was left feeling tight
pulls on the skin when you apply it
air-conditionned hotel rooms where you cannot open any windows
rolls off of my skin
it would get on my pillow
after it set in my skin after a few minutes i rubbed my face
it peels off like flakes even one or two hours after i applied it
give that about 5min to set
also when i put make up on in the morning after using this moisturizer
i've noticed that it also dried out my entire face
my only problem is that when i wake up in the mornings
did not make me tear up
hasn't done much to help the fine lines starting to form under my eyes in my mid-twenties
for the lines around my mouth i find no improvement
applying it i inevitably tug at the skin around my eyes
firm up some fine lines around the eyes
did nothing for the very fine lines around my bottom lip
i am trying to find an eye cream
put it on before bed
it gave me more fine lines plus millia seeds
sephora bring back the too faced wrinkle eraser
it kind of gets stuck on my skin
i only gave it a three star rating because i only use it as a lip cream
this product stung my eyes
just like every other eye cream out there
the only way to put it on is to dot
plumping up the fine lines
the fine lines are back
try eye hope or miracle worker eye cream
having it so close to my nose
when i was washing my face my eyes were burning really bad
this did well at removing my makeup
no matter how carefully i have washed my face with it
i broke out all along my chin
my make-up started to look chalky and bad.
lines around my eyes started to pop up almost out of no where
this really damaged my skin
it removes make up
i only suggest that you cut a chunk off first
i found this soap to leave a film on my face.
after oil control face wash
by lunch if i wipe my nose i can see
i spot tested this moisturizer on my face to see if i would break out from it
forever in search for a good firming eye cream
bug it did nothing to tighten the skin under the eyes
while i only have fine lines
i out it on a night before bed
when i wake up to shower in the morning
with other creams its goes away with more sleep
this was basically lotion for under my eyes
then my eyes were puffy
for the fine lines underneath my eyes to go away
while it did remove dirt
my face was irritated / red the whole week i used it
it left a lot of makeup behind even after two washes
leaves my face tight
this broke me out so hard on my chin
i wear double wear
after a couple days of using it i started noticing that i would sneeze every time i would wash my face with this product
my face was starting to become itchy
i tried this and it instantly dried my face out.
could clean my whole face at the end of the day
it made my eyes burn
decided to try this "all about the eyes" cream
i actually had a couple of nasty breakouts near my eyes
around the inner corner of my eye
spreads all over my face during the day
want to get rid of them
my fine lines were still there
where people regularly ask why i have black eyes
just for the rest of my face
i noticed it did brighten my dark circles just after one use
i will finish up my tub
in the morning under makeup
i've never been someone who has issues with puffy eyes only fine lines
i keep messing with new eye creams
get rid of dark circles or attack crows feet
however after a couple of days of wear i realized my eye were always watery
who works outside a bit
tried it out for about 2 weeks to see if the break outs were maybe caused by my skin just adjusting to the new product
it never really got absorbed even on my dryer cheek areas
the rest of my face is normal with acne
my skin began to turn back to how it normally is
even with no foundation i found myself having to dab my face within 3 hours
by the afternoon i need to blot
only on my nose
after a couple of hours the dryness started to slighty show again
the only way i could get it to moisturize my face at all was if i smothered my face with it
it left sort of film/residue on my skin that i feel coming off while washing my face at night
when i first apply it i feel a slight tingling sensation that goes away after a couple of minutes
this made is so hard to wash off my face.
the fact that the petals kind of melted away when you put it on freaked me out
broke me out in my oilier areas
which caused my normal foundation routine to break up
since i was going for something to replenish my skin
it did sting my eyes
everytime i apply it after showers or cleansing my face
it literally made my eyes water
i returned it since i need better sun protection.
my face started to develop little red blemishes after day 2
my face burned for hours
when i finally washed it off my cheeks
i got no sun protection from this
if you're planning on swimming it burns your eyes
i remember it making my skin so soft that i had to purchase it right away
it made my skin break out
my face cleared up instantly
it didnt clean everything off of my skin.
makes skin flare up
it took a long break with tatcha products for the acne flare up that was caused by this product to finally go away
when you used it to get off your eye make up mascara
i washed my face normally after using
it unfortunately gave me bumps around my chin
i end up having to use eye-makeup remover
my brush was completely covered in makeup after i finished cleansing
after having massaged this stuff all over my face
this won't cut it
worst of all it leaves a film with left over foundation all over the face
it also left a film on my face.
it off my face
it gets the makeup off.
i actually had to use another cleanser to wipe off the extra highlight
tried it twice to remove all my face makeup
it does an okay job at taking off makeup.
there tends to be bb cream left on my face after washing the product off
i hope my breakouts go away :(
to top it off it made my under eye area itchy.
plus my eye were always irritated from some ingredients
the next time i decided to give it a try again it was daytime before i put on my makeup i dabbed some of this eye cream again 30 mins later my eyes were stinging
i will have half of the eye cream left
some would remain trapped at the inner corner of the bottle
the tube inside the pump is so short
still a bunch of it remains trapped by the corners
i mean one in which my eyes started to water
you have to throw away small amount of it because it dries out
it burns my eyes when it runs into my eyes
i didnt put it to close to my actual eyeball or anything
makes them water to the point that i can barely open my eyes
save yourself the time
my eyes were burning
i couldn't wait to get to the restaurant to wash this off
after rinsing my eyes for about 5 minutes they started to feel better
naturally when i got home
the sample went into the garbage after i washed the cream off
after using this product a few times i noticed it just made my eyes tickle
or outside sweating or even in the airconditioning inside
good protection for your eye area under make-up
it feels thick when you first put it on
it doesnt sting when applied too close to the eyes
whoever decided to start putting spfs into eye creams was so wrong
my eyes are tearing right now at just the memory of how awful this was
this one caused my eyes to burn
if the product gets too close to the eye
a half of using this some of the product got onto my lashes
3 hours later rubbed into my eye
it won't take off heavy make up.
the product would only foam up half-heartedly after a while
brought my acne back
the ability to really cleanse the face of makeup is missing
then still continue to get makeup off after with a removing wipe
i can get away with cleaning my face with this with just one pump
wasn't blown away by it
every time i would put it in a bag for an overnight or travel
then cleanse away any remaining makeup on my face
this cleanser has left its mark on my face
there are better face washes out there that clean
i wanted something that cleaned off my makeup
just slide off my face
my mascara just ran down my face
if you put on makeup after using it prepare to look oily all day
it has left me with mixed feelings
then trying to wash it off
my face had that terrible tight feeling after washing
so use a make up remover before washing your face
after switching to a new cleanser within a day my huge pimples were gone
pounds of moisturizer just to get it back to normal
it usually takes a day to calm down
i got this face wash as a recommendation from a youtuber
clinique's take the day off balm is amazing though
i either massage it into my skin for 1 minute or use my clarisonic
i even used clinique's "take the day off" cleansing balm for taking off makeup
just okay face wash
good for taking makeup off
i need to apply moisturizer immediately after washing my face with this cleanser or else my face starts to feel tight
my skin gets red within a minute of drying my face
after cleaning my face i felt dried out
my skin was so tight i almost felt it cracking
didn't leave my face feeling clean
i still was able to see my pores on my cheeks as well as my nose
had to wash my face twice to get make up all off.
for me it left my skin stripped down of every last bit of moisture
my face broke out immediately mostly in the chin area
then i eliminated the good genes
finally i tried a different moisturizer
i tested this primer by wearing 1/2 my face with it
literally no difference the entire day.
it just pills when i put it on
whenever i go to squeeze product out
even though it did hid pores
my foundation has separated so bad
while using this my make up looked so greasy after like 2 hours
makes me foundation slide off
then throughout the day i realized i still got creases in my laugh lines
this product made me breakout all over my cheeks
i got this as a spear point perk
oily as soon as i put it on my face
this just gets stuck in them
now i have bumps in their place
it looks like it sits on top of my skin
my makeup stayed on perfectly all day
my oil comes right through it
the sales lady sold me on this when she said it will make your pores disappear
maybe gives me an extra hour in the morning before i need to blot/powder
right out of the tube it was orange on me
it seemed to fade away into my skin
it makes my foundation slip off
everything i put on turned to an amazing shade of orange within minutes
aka next to my nose on both sides
foundation was polka dotted across my face
guess i'm stuck with it
except for running into my eyes when i slept
this goes on light
this means i'll go through it in no time flat
instead, it made me break out.
my skin ended up with more red spots
thankfully my skin is clearing up
just lays on top
returned it because i missed cleansers that foam up
after i wash my face
basically just rolled off of my bb cream making my makeup feel
lots of residue was left afterwards.
i'd just prefer a 1-step cleanser that can remove everything on my face in one step
the jury is still out on the cleanser.
the product doesnt take off my makeup
it doesn't come close to taking off my makeup or cleaning my face-
soothing going on my face
i ended up having to wash my face over
over to get rid of makeup
on the plus side
can't even address the brightening effects because i had to wash it off after 5 minutes
it just plumped my skin for a while.
even after massaging it on my face
like i do when i put on the face cream
burning all night long
when i applied it to my eyes it started peeling in certain areas
then the intense fragrance almost made me nauseated
this cream was too heavy for use on my face.
i ended up having to go dermatologist to get a cream to help stop the burning
then i went to get my regular times face peel
i assume because i am rougher in that area when i swipe my toner on with a cotton round
i woke up the next day to find my whole face covered with small pimples
night i put it on my face as soon as i brush my teeth to when i'm about to hit the pillow
this product peels off when you try to apply foundation over the top of it
the minute i put it on my skin, it pilled.
when i started to get blemishes
her pimples are not clearing up.
eventually my skin got itchy after application within a week
its when the products balls up
flakes off making it no point in using
it has cleared up her acne
in addition it irritated around my nose
didnt have any effect on tired eyes
all that it did was make my makeup roll up
felt like i put bengay on my face--it burned.
spent the next month or so trying to get rid of the blemishes
my skin has since cleared up again like normal
then if i even so much as brush my fingers against my face
forget about using this with a face oil
it's fine to wear under make up
the rest of my face isn't
this gave me little bumps underneath my eyes.
just made cracks under my eyes
it "peels" right off when i go to put the primer on
it just sits on the top until you wipe it off.
it just sits on top of the skin
it really did nothing in terms of breaking down my full face of makeup
while it is okay taking off face makeup
will leave your face with a lot of make up residues
i followed the directions both ways- wiping off
it did a terrible job of breaking down my make up
any time it came anywhere close to my eyes
then wiped off with a cotton ball or cotton pad
barely takes off any of my makeup.
this product actually ended up smearing the mascara on the sides of my face
really not for removing eye make-up.
get all the makeup off
literally scrubbed my face with it
there is always left over make up on the towel when i dry my face
i am returning back to the rise off foaming cleanser
my cotton ball was full of make up
it didn't clean off my make up
they are beyond spectacular at removing makeup
love the original take day off make up remover for lids/lashes/lips as well as the take the day off cleansing balm
in spite of all of this i didn't feel like it removed my make-up at all
flush my eyes because the burning was so bad
i do like the product to take off my make up.
even after that my pencil eye liner is still on.
the nozzle is too short that if i don't pick it up to get the product the milk goes all over the bottle
sometimes when i'm in a rush i leave in on the table
i should've returned it right away because after a week of use since i don't have any other cleanser for now it's already half way empty
left whatever makeup it eventually took off in a huge oil sheen ring in my sink
it is not an eye make up remover
this didn't come close to even taking off the concealer
buy some just to feel like my face was clean at the end of the day while using this "cleansing milk
gone back to my regular product
you can see all the makeup on the swab after wiping it on your face
then i follow with an acne wash
then have to finish off with a toner to remove the remnants of make up
even after that i still saw makeup when i dried my face
i recommend ignoring the part about how you can rinse it away with water
it did a fine job of removing any face make up
did nothing for my eye make-up
by then it had gotten into my eyes resulting in a burning sensation
i tried to take off my eye makeup
was told that it act as make up remover
had to rinse my eyes under water for minutes to get rid of the product
i just took off the rest of the remaining makeup on my face with lancome's cleansing water
my blemishes are already clearing up
had to scrub for a while to get off
it just dragged my eyeliner
it stung my eyes
including my eye makeup
it burned my eyes so badly
left them stinging for an hour
have loved the take the day off balm.
it removed most makeups on my face, not all.
i planned on using it at the gym to take my foundation off without removing my eye makeup before i worked out
it started to balled up on my face
put it on before bed time
it dried out my skin the next day
i start breaking out like crazy overnight with lots lots lots of red dots
shiseido's satin finish foundation without having any problem
it sorta just layed on top of my face.
woke up with my face flaking
it took only a bit to cover my face
when i put it on it made my eyes red
the odd thing is all the letters on the glass jar on the front
it's on my fingers when i pick up the bottle to put it away
my skin will retaliate big-time
i eventually had to wash my face to get rid of the smell
rather than waking up to a moiturized refreshed face
it just leaves them super shiny the next day
my hair kept getting stuck to it
it made my entire face greasy
however, the fine lines weren't filled in.
i did have problems with the cream migrating into my eyes at times
my question: has anyone else noticed lash loss from using this product?
it just didn't make a difference on my 30 year old baby fine lines
my eyes would cry
wake up to it still being very greasy
fine lines under eyes
i needed a good cleansing wipe for after my workouts
if i skip washing my face for a night
my face then starts to feel greasy/heavy after a while
my face shined like the sun which is against what this product is advertised for
even after blotting my face was super oily again an hour later
this product will keep me shine free for about 3 hours
at the end of the day i am still a grease ball
instead i was an oily mess before noon
my face is not matte looking about 10 minutes after applying it
a couple hours later it makes my face super super oily
my skin still ends up oily at the end of the day.
right now i started having small acne around my cheeks area
i do find that i have to do a bit of blotting around the 5-6 hour mark
sometimes it would even show up an hour after putting the lotion on
this made my face an oil mess immediately after i applied it
my face was ridiculously slipping
powder constantly to try to mop it up
shaking the product out
it seems like my face gets oily now after an hour of it being on
end up using it as a "throw away" product
once i stopped using it my breakouts cleared up
when i wear it during the day underneath my makeup
oil just keeps coming
then after about an hour feels super greasy
after completely used up a jar
wake up with big pores in the morning
so although it helped my dryer spots
i stuck it out hoping to correct my wrinkles
seemed to almost drag across my skin
it made me break out instantly
i washed it off instantly.
right after using this my face felt like a greasy
maybe i'll use this for my heels .
my face is okay with their chemicals.
it's currently sitting underneath my bathroom sink
going to stick with the ibuki line
using both products together caused me to break out
the skin on my face felt uncomfortably tight every time i used this
i noticed it after every wash
it completely stripped off any moisture i had left in my skin
my checks were flushed
it was still feeling tight at the end of the day
i just using this in the morning for a quick refresh
it seems to sit on top of the skin
i started to get some red spots
it's taking a while for my skin to adjust to it
kind of "sits" on my skin.
leaves a dewy finish right after applying.
i started to get some red spots
there on my face
it brightens up your face a lot only when your are putting it on
after washing my face got back to how it is
after my cleanser at night then on top of that i use boscia recharging night moisture
then glide this one on
/or am very stressed out i might neglect my face cleaning nightly routine
when i put my foundation on
nose of too many trips to a beach
staying out in the sun
now i gave up on this product of giving me brightening benefits on my dark spots
you never want to carry this around in your bag cause it weights a ton
you will notice the difference after just 1 week if you're not constantly out in the sun
it takes a very long time to soak into my skin
drink at least 6 cups of water a day
lightening the spots on my face
most of the time i have to wash my face after applying it just to make my face feel a little free
my usual clear clean skin started to breakout like a teenager
if i put it on right before i go to bed
i got pimples all over my face after using only once
as it would pill/ball up around the edges of where it was applied
it separated like crazy
i tried putting it under my eyes without completely rubbing it in before i went to bed
that seemed to give my eyes a little perk to them when i woke up
i do get dark circles under my eyes
dark circle which it claimed to do
took forever to sink in
woke up with horribly puffy eyes :
this gave me 2 lines under my eyes of wrinkles!!!
have been trying to fight undereye lines for a while
good under eye make up
not the eye cream i was hoping for my dark circles
it never leaves my face feeling cleansed.
other dirt off my face
the top of the bottle literally snaps on
it was enough for the top to pop right off
t literally poured out of the container really quickly
it was like seeing all my dollar bills laying on the floor
i still had a lot of makeup on my cotton ball when i put on my toner
fresh feeling after using it
my face never seemed clean after using this
it made me break out on my forehead only after 3 days of use
a bunch of new blemishes have popped up
my face cleared up after i stopped using it.
while it did clean my skin
for some reason this stuff causes my face to go into overdrive with oil purging
since it turns my face into an oil slick as my day goes on
or until it goes in the bin
i like the rest of the ren ever calm line
soothing when you can't fall asleep
the cloth had a lot of excess makeup that was left on my skin from before
clean again before going in with a cleanser
after i washed this off
leaving this one on for 10-20 seconds made my skin feel tight as soon as i stepped out the shower
this broke me out on my chin
the rest of my face hated it
i smelled it strongly in the evenings when i placed my head to my pillow
this was even after thoroughly washing my face.
the one coming from my bottle which lingered on my skin was too distracting
it leaves a film on my face
seems to be causing my skin to break out
figured to change up my daily regimen
it hardly took any of my make up off
i've never had a cleanser take as little make up off as this one
first thing i noticed squeezing it into my h
then i tried spreading it between my h
then when i tried rinsing it off
i wash my face in the shower
i'll feel the rest of my skin compared to my face
still breaking out in places
all the grim from the day
feels like there is a film on my face after i rinse it off
it also made areas of my skin break out
then you go out in the cold then back into heat
my dark circles under my eyes are still the same.
my eyes started tearing like i was chopping onions for good 15 min
it did leqve my skin refreshed the next day
i already had a sour taste in my mouth from being passed off to please the rep
it really burns my eyes when i use it too close to my eyes
depuffing my eyes after crying
where you dip your finger into
out to me even with miminal 'concerns' around the eye area
i felled like i was tapping my under eyes forever to get the product absorbs
it feels like i'm putting nothing more than some water-down hair gel around my eyes
fine lines under my eyes
i don't have many fine lines around my eyes
the execution has more problems than you can shake a stick at
this one made my eyes miserable for an hour
fine lines have started showing up
give my eyes more of an "awake" look
i am still waiting for it to revive my tired eyes
if you want to revive your eyes, get more sleep.
this product stung my eyes
after 3 days left the skin around my eyes red
don't have to tug on my eye area
it does not make my eyes appear rested
instead of having just the dark circles
this absorbed into my skin within about 10 minutes after applying
when i woke up my pores looked bigger
came up in little white bumps after using it for a week
a few times i left it on all day instead of rinsing my face
i find the smell a bit off putting
i woke up with a wrinkle around my mouth
it pulled out some of my black heads
" reduces the appearance for the 5 minutes after your rub it off
this mask is fine
i didn't think it removed the deep down dirt or dead layers of skin as it promises to do
(bottle design is nice but tip dries up a bit)
i don't like the rubbing action on my face
now it comes in a heavy glass bottle with a pump that is so difficult to get product out of that i ended up pouring it into another bottle
didn't leave my face feeling clean
i've gone through 5 bottles now
on 3 out of 5 the plastic wrap on the pump was so glued on to it
go back to the plastic squeeze bottle
my face still feels dirty after using this also
i like to wash my whole face at night including my eyes
hoping for a light at the end of the tunnel.
bring back the tube.
the cap breaks off
the cap pops off all the time in the shower
super heavy to pack in the suitcase
forget trying to hold onto the bottle with even a drop of water on your h
felt that fire burn
this just made the acne pop up again
of course i still get a pimple or black head here
clear up my face
i found that it did help to clear up my acne
every single time i put my moisturizer on it flakes
it just rubs right off
i ended up using it on most of my face as i'm prone to acne
mild acne that flares up at that time of the month
it started clearing up my acne within days
make my spots more red
even after allowing it over 30 minutes to completely dry on your face
i broke out just as often in the same places on my face
skin is still breaking out
i could only use it at night because when i put on my moisturizer in the morning it would pill up??
it cleared up my skin so quickly
i still wake up to new ones avery morning.
this wound up in the trash.
i've tried darn near everything to clear up my skin
my skin was not stripped
i'll continue to use up my bottle
i want it to get deep into my pores
i will use up the bottle
philosophy give me my microdelivery back!!
i couldn't get it to calm down until i stopped using this
when i first starting washing my face the smell from this wash was horrible
still leaves behind a good amount of makeup
this happened with their clear days ahead moisturizer
now this face wash
it breaks me out.
the skin problem went away
broke out in tiny little irritation bumps all over
my skin feels tight after an hour of application.
had to put in eye drops
i tried using it again avoiding my eyes
it works well under make-up
takes some time to sink into my skin
i'll stick with the 3 step.
after i quit using this it cleared up
it is so irritating i took it back.
year round sun protection
this is not the case with the bobby brown extra eye repair
after using it i could see a little difference in the fine lines around my eye area
just made my face more oily after setting in.
all it did was bring all the dirt to the surface
save yourself the trouble
dried my face out to the point it became red
i broke out like crazy in little bumps all over my forehead
by the end of the workday it looked like i'd run a marathon instead of sitting behind a desk
to say the least i started breaking out like crazy on my chin
started clearing up right away
it seems to sink into my skin after a while
gets in my hair during the night
because i know anyone who washes their face every night before going to bed
don't need a deep cleanse when they wake up
rub it all over my face before it dissipates
this looked like a serious mix-up
i ended up drying out my face.
i tried this after hearing people rave about how it cleaned up their skin
i stop using it till i found out it getting my skin worse
my acne was not going away
now my inner cheeks are breaking out too
i started to have horrible break outs on my forehead
my face felt fresh
i still had make up on after rinsing.
i still get small spots on my chin
i literally hold my breath when i use it.
it just flat out didn't work
my face would just be super red
everywhere i put this product turned my skin into a red burning itching mess
while it was great to put on under or over moisturizer in terms of texture
this does clear up my breakout spots
the other product cleared it up
it doesn't clear up skin overnight
this is odd being that its supposed to help heal.
it does leave my face refreshed
clean the morning after
the sticky feeling discouraged me from applying it all over my face
acne scars are slowly going away here
my face would get really dried up in the middle of the day
in the am i never left the house without any sunscreen on my face
others got darker from being burned
on my cheeks now only starting to fade
evened out my skin tone more than the murad gel
eventually leaving me with dark spots/acne scars
it dries up where you apply it
it also made my blemishes sting once i put it on
still have dark spots all over my face
it started making me break out with tiny white heads
now i have dark spots
they were fading on their own
when you put it on areas around your mouth
it didn't work on me after using up the whole bottle
its just about hit the bottom of the bottle.
as someone that was a heavy amount of dark spots
at first i thought my skin needed to adjust
passed off the acne as just a step i had to go thru to get better skin
on the lookout for the next silver bullet...
night as a spot treatment
the bottle is almost empty now
has been using these as a sort of aftershave to help keep irritation down
in his inscrutable way gave them the thumbs up by continuing to use them
wash my face again
i break out like a mountain range the next morning
i immediately washed my face
i put it on woke up the next morning with 4 new pimples
turn red in one night
n the morning my face looked blotchy even with make up
this made my face break out
without fail i wake up red
save your money ladies!
don't let conditioner get on my back
soap at the sink instead
just to use it up
that i am now using it to clean my makeup brushes with
it did nothing to remove any blemishes or break outs after 4 weeks of use
kept my back clean
i also took precautions such as washing my back last so that there would be no conditioner residue that would interfere
the soap left my skin feeling like it had a rough film on it
i find that in almost every bar soap
helping clear up my acne on my back
my acne on my face doesn't go away like the ones on my back
my skin is going through a cray phase right.
i am desperately searching for something to get rid of my breakouts
i used it together with the entire bosnia clear complexion line for six weeks
then massage away the dirt
it does get my skin clean right away
i ended up having to use two cleansers at night because this one was so gentle it wouldn't remove all of my makeup
noticed each time that it left my skin very tight straight out of the shower
left my face really tight
it cleared my skin up somewhat
covered in red break outs
it just made my skin flip out
knew i needed to change my face wash
i got this as part of the clear complexion kit.
i just recently started delving into creating my own skin care routine
i used it together with the entire bosnia clear complexion line for six weeks
the whole clear complexion line from boscia made me break out
i feel that the acne just cleared up on it's own not that this sped it up
i still see the occasional break outs
bought this in combination with the clear complexion cleanser hoping it would clear up
prevent my face from the acne flare ups i have
sides of my face where my glasses sit
this however has been keeping them away!
rejuvenated after using this
this is a nice lightweight gel that disappeared into my skin immediately
under my make up in the morning
i noticed a difference right away
my bottle is nearing empty
brought the murad kit up to the counter
i think 4 weeks to "purge" skin
it does remove make-up well
ing on a counter top or in the shower
after you remove your make-up
my makeup got all over the towel
it made me break out on my cheeks
it kind of left a film on my skin
barely cleaned only the first layer of make up off
it seems like it was deep cleansing at all.
especially around my mouth area
i would probably have to wash my face 20 times a day with this to keep it redness-free
feels like straight up lotion on your face.
it cleared up my redness right away
then put this on my cheeks
i put on a light layer only on that part of my face
it breaks out my whole face
getting waxed leaves me red for the entire day
this product actually burned when i put it on
had an off-putting scent
i will keep on using to see if my redness goes away
which makes me break out
after i wash my face at night
my skin breaks out
my skin looked so greasy for hours after
woke up looking shiny
my mom noticed right away my face was clearer
soothing when i put it on
with some red spot here
just use it before i go to bed or during the day i don't ware make up
causing some break outs
calm my skin at first using it
sent me a small bottle of foundation make up
once i quit using on my forehead, it cleared up.
i couldn't finish the entire tube
my skin looks the same after the mask as it does before
since day 1 every time i put it on soon after i wake up with breakouts everywhere
it may get rid of the dead skin
the cloth that it comes with is really what's working for taking off any dead skin
the next morning i woe up with massive break outs all over my face
i leave this mask on for 15 minutes
it is left feeling clean
it gave some irritation on my face
fresh for the day
my only complaint is that the shape of the container is an odd shape
then put another cream over it
short of dumping the little bottle into my night cream
i always have to clean up the extra powder off my sink which gets annoying in a daily am rush
end up wasting it
i put some in the palm of my h
then add the powder
it sinks into my skin
a forehead covered in spots i had to take it back
it took a while to get the texture of my skin back to normal
there was always some powder residue that either did not come off the scoop or was knocked off the rim of the bottle opening
you had to mix your concoction together before applying to your face
it will leave my face will lots of white fibres
useless，not real work on the black circle
it will go away--
after wearing it at night i felt like i woke up with even darker circles under my eyes
for the dark circles around my eyes
my past experiences with eye creams that don't live up to their hype
i'll go back to living with my racoon eyes
then you have to have plastic surgery
i am not looking to soften under eye fine lines i'm looking to at least somewhat lighten my raccoon eye circles
every morning i'd wake up
i used this product on the dark circle under my left eye 2x a day for 3 weeks
lie awake most of the night wondering
i am amazed…i feel sleepy but i look wide awake.
needless to say i took it back.
i find the cream gets completely absorbed around my eyes within a minute
my concealer would get into my fine lines more
good for daytime under eye makeup.
the dark circles under my eyes are still there
won't put a dent in my wallet
i hope my dark circles will eventually or gradually go away
after applying my makeup on top of it
works well under make up
it actually gave me lines around my eyes
actually ended up giving me styes on both my eyes
s right away because my fingers will feel rough after a minute
put it on my skin overnight
my cheeks had a tough
when rubbing it into my skin i need to re apply right after a few times
i quickly changed my mind
lid was kept screwed on when not in use
it breaks down your makeup within an hour of application
i woke up to red skin
then a primer before foundation with my beauty blender
it still would pile on my skin because of this moisturizer
onto the next moisturizer :(
when i woke up i was covered in zits all over
left me looking greasy
giving it over 20 minutes to soak in
plus bathroom paper on my face
my face stopped being red
my skin burned the moment i started to apply it
made it turn red
burning sensation went away
had to wash it off.
left a strange film on my face
when i apply it in the mornings the moment i apply my make up
...and it tends to sit on top of my skin.
it just balled up on my face.
so keep that in mind before using this moisturizer
both products end up mostly coming off in pills of product
start to rub off my face
along with this one
they all burn my face when putting them on
the burning sensation did eventually go away
didn't make my face feel suffocated
kind of immediately stings my face almost in patches
use it on my neck only.
that fades in seconds
then i have little rolls of foundation all over my face
i couldn't return this product because i'm away in a small city for college
it just pilled on application.
plus the burning sensation it left was uncomfortable
made my skin burn almost immediately
it was a disaster under my make-up
this made my face break out.
woke up with numerous pimples around my mouth.
caused me to break out horribly
it ended up destroying my skin
i try to stay away from anything that foams
a few weeks into using it it started to smell like rotten fish
need something to break up the oil
i like the face finishing cream
i used the gentle cleanser for a brief period until it started to break me out badly
i realized after i picked up the toner
it only irritated the skin around my eyes
who wants a glass container in the bathroom?
i patiently kept on using it
i am hlaf bottle down
i work a lot of night shifts.
it falls back to normal
i've always had the misfortune of dark under-eye circles
products made to go near your eyes should not sting
ended up developing some burning feeling around the corners of my eyes whenever i applied the cream
trashed the bottle half way through
this eye treatment has done nothing to reduce the fine lines around my eye area
it started to burn my skin
like i'd put a hot curling iron under my eyes
the top keeps on coming off
feels like i have saran wrap on
my face is still breaking out
that the product had ruined my under eyes
on one eye this time
make up left over
went back to my purity cleanser
if i hadn't thrown the box away i'd return it.
7 out of the 10 days my eyes burned
then i had intense peeling
i tried to ignore the smell because i was assured that it would tone up my frown lines instantly
aside from the breakout
once you start rubbing it in
i tried this with the rest of the perricone anti-aging line
it didn't remove any makeup aside from some light foundation
like the way this cleans my face
only problem is the pump stopped working getting the foam out it takes minutes of pumping to get a dime size out
after starting to use this cleanser as directed i've broken out horribly all over my face
it did the job of cleaning my face
i hated the invisible film i felt on my face after using it
after the first wash my face was stretched taut
i still kept it around
then when i'm too tired to go through my regular cleansing routine
the effect does go away
left my face feeling tight with a pulling sensation
considering throwing the rest of my bottle out
within 5 minutes of applying the product my skin felt tight
maybe it's better for the summer instead of the middle of a northeast winter
did a good job of banishing the flakies
it took forever to absorb into my skin
it left a greasy feeling all over my face
it sort of just sits on top of your skin leaving your face feeling clunky
this cream caused a lot of break outs
my face instantly felt smothered
start all my over
almost sweaty after using it
washed it off right away
had to wash my face to remove it
it sits on the top of my skin like a mask
i looked closer at the ingredients
it just sits on top
both of which break me out
by the end of the day i had new blemishes coming to the surface
keep my skin clear
it just laid on top of my skin
cannot bear to put it on my face.
so i use it for my hands instead.
this cream felt like i wiped baby oil on my face
while i love the fresh product line
what was most upsetting was that there was a huge air bubble in the jar
once i stuck my finger in to get the cream
it starts off mildly cucumbery then starts smelling rotten
hate it but stuck with it.
woke up with several clogged pores
15 minutes later, i still had a shine to my face.
i find that it sits on top
my face felt greasy after using it at night
i kept waking up with an oily face
i couldn't get past it seemingly sitting on top of my skin
i finally had to wipe my face off with a tissue to the get the greasiness off
i used it after washing my skin before bed
the next day my entire face was covered in hideous acne
greasy on my skin when i put it on
like the fresh rose face mask
i will stick to my sheet
it turned out my face so red
i broke out with a good amount of little annoying white heads
it made me breakout all over my nose
keep coming back to fresh
i love the over night mask though!
it just wreaked havoc on my face
it just messed up my face
it broke me out in white heads all over.
without a full face of makeup i would have to wash my face over
no amount of cleansing would take the makeup off.
was surprised to see the cotton full of what looks like left over foundation from my face
leave any residue behind
this dealt like it stripped my skin leaving it really tight
after philosophy stopped making their cleanser in a foam
i'll use the rest of it
this does take all my make up off
every morning i wake up with at least 1 new pimple
it does an ok job washing my make up off
not so well on the eye make up when using primer
it leaves a horrible residue on my face
my cotton round was full of residue left over from this not removing all of my makeup
left my skin feeling tight after using
switched over from philosiphy because i love everything lancome
since switching to this face wash i've been breaking out into awful acne along my jaw line
other than my face wash
it seems to clean my face.
i broke out really bad on my forehead
it lathers up like crazy
while it does remove make up
as soon as i started rubbing it on my face
leaving an awful residue
it takes make up off really well other than that i don't see the huge difference fr the rest
the cleanser didn't give me clean feeling after washing my face
it takes a few swipes to remove makeup
placed over my eye
let sit pressing lightly to dissolve the makeup
without fail i would wake up with breakouts
i tried this at the store to remove some makeup on my h
i wanted a step up from my normal makeup remover wipes
it will take off the remnants of makeup
or what your makeup remover missed on your face
is that i can remove my make-up with it
this really cleans deep down
you really need a separate eye make-up remover
i put it all over my face
probably returning to sephora because i'm fed up.
my skin has broke out in pimples allll over the place
adding this on l into my daily routine has dried up my skin
this product feels sticky going on then soaks right into my shin
we are in the middle of winter
it's drawing it out of my skin instead
now it just sits on my bathroom shelf
this product sits on top of the skin
even with overnight use
never absorbed into my skin
it seemed to sit on top of my skin
leaving no moisture behind
interfered with whatever moisturizer i tried to use over it
take it out of the box
i am now stuck with barely any product left
follow up with body
summer is around the corner
it left my face all greasy
i tried it without make up with a little powder on top
then under make up
soaked in right away keeping it very soft
break out all over
instead of the original formula that was more of a light whipped-type moisturizer that soaked right in
it always soaked right in
i found myself having to dab my face after applying it to remove the shine
/or made my face red
dries quick enough to apply make up right after without a wait
by the end of the day it starts running into my eyes
i don't put it around my eyes
protect me from the sun
i notice my make up stick and clumps.
i still need to buy something to put on top of this moisturizer to help me to protect my skin
within 3 days of using this i had a huge breakout all over my cheeks
got philosophy hope in a jar
this product caused red bumps on my all over my face
every morning there was a new little red bump at a new location on my face
got rid of one of their levels
aside from having spf
this product left my face red
i did stick my nose in the tester at sephora
just walk out the door on a lazy morning without makeup layered on top
but my face begins to burn after applying it.
since i only wear mac's studio fix powder
i double cleans with oil first so no idea how good it is at removing makeup
i just pour it out
the cream it self is so thick i had to really rub into my skin instead if it gliding smoothly on it
it was too heavy for my combination skin even when "warming" it up between my fingers before use
it just sits on top of your skin
i don't want to throw it away.
so they had to be cleaned right away
so much fragrance it made my eyes water every time i wore it
my eyes were red
it did tighten up the bags
the irritation went away
my eyes still look the same.
overpowering that i started to get a headache
throughout the day i could see my fine lines around my eyes
ended up spreading it down till my cheek bones
they were stinging like crazy
my makeup was sliding all over my face on top of it
still left the house with it on.
only use this in the middle of my face
i still have to touch up with powder at least twice a day
i broke out with bad acne with white heads those one that hurts a lot i had to take medication to calm my face down
normal on the rest of my face
after trying out all kinds of face washes
kept me matte all day
kept my oils at bay
it kept me "matte" for like 2 1/2 hours
then the oil spilled out of my face
i apply this before my make up after a while i feel as if i get extra greasy
don't wake up looking like a grease ball
i ended up feeling the need to grab a primer
messed up my foundation
an hour or 2 into my air conditioned work day
i say i was shine free for 6 hours max
woke up with white heads all over my chin
will use it up.
in the afternoon park of my face skin peeling off
i felt it suffocated my skin a bit too much while i wore it under makeup
left a film on my face
try to avoid the eye area when cleansing.
this cleanser just stripped all oil out of my skin
left it feeling tight
after about 3 days of use i was getting small breakouts on my cheek
since it just left my face uncomfortable i stopped using it
the way it cleaned my face was nothing special
although has done nothing for the line across my forehead
on the down side
at the end of the day when i cleanse my face
another sign that it is just sitting on top of my skin
so i use it as a neck cream now.
however even after waiting 30 mins to apply makeup it balls up something horrid
if i rub/touch my face at any point in the day it also balls up
rubs off into little pieces
then later rub my face
i would got up with a greasy-sticky feeling face in the morning
yesterday i got this huge volcano on my face
i would wake up with slightly tight skin
it just sits on my face
i hope it does not end up all on my pillow while i sleep
fine lines are starting to creep up
it did nothing to fade my sun spots
i want it to work overtime on my skin while i sleep
i love their lifting eye cream
i tired it at night
dark circles over the lack of sleep
it was not over powering or bad
also using this along with the genefique eye concentrate at night
my eyes are refreshed in the morning
the wrinkles would minimize right away
i started to notice that a little bit later the product would clump up
i line filled with the renergie eye lift cream
once its on for a minute or so the burning sensation begins to subside
while it did help with the dark circles
then after using the cream twice a day for a couple weeks my fine lines looked worse because the skin around my eye became very dry
it just sits on my skin it took me some time to massage it
after i manage to get it off the wrong surface
it sits on top of my skin until i massage it for a minute or so
the skin under my eyes turned red
it took about a week to heal.
was a product that immediately burned the skin around my eyes
the product had separated with all this water liquid on the top
fine lines around my eyes to make them look fuller
i would wake up in the morning with skin that was tight
when the sweat starts pouring
was super itchy- others could see all the small bumps covering my face
it almost instantly broke me out all around my mouth
i will use up the jar i have
and the scent stays awhile.
then by 3pm my face was peeling so badly
and it lingers for a while on your face!!!!!
wears off within an hour
she wears it every day now
after just two days of using this i had tiny breakouts all over my forehead
my skin is back to normal
lilttle by lilttle ance kept popping up til it was bad
immediately my skin calm down
it gets my makeup off and cleans my face.
when back to my original face wash
throw it out of whack
it completely dried out my skin to the point that it hurts
a day after using it their are white dots all over my skin
before i apply eye shadow
while you do wash it off
great way to get rid of makeup without damaging skin with regular soap
i went back to my kinerase gentle wash.
not the clarisonic brush it came with
its a twist cap that doesnt come off so when you use it you can't just set it back down you have to wipe the excess thats there from closing the twist cap
this cleanser will not remove your eye make up
while this did help clear them up
my make up stopped staying well
my skin cleared up almost immediately
when you twist it close, more oozes out.
left my face feeling fresh
in fact i almost took this expensive cleanser back
it just slips off when you add water.
it does work at leaving your skin clean
the pump is the push down type which i haven't really seen in a moisturizer before
i realized my face was so dry i had to go put my old moisturizer on
even cracking in places
the bottom is completely empty
after about 2 weeks of use i had acne popping up left
my acne cleared up right away
put about 1/4 on my neck
this product did the complete opposite of moisturizer my face
it was a nauseating smell that lingered for over an hour on your face
picked this up because sephora got rid of the dermalquench clear acne treatment
it cleared my skin
then the following week it dried my whole face.
this completely dried out my skin to the point where it was peeling
that's right after you already washed the lotion off
i would recommend her blemish banisher set instead of this
it can't be placed all over.
it made my face tight and would make me itch.
i tried it with a regular non-acne fighting face wash
there was some light break outs
didnt work for me, made me break out!!
cheek area that wont go away
this product never sunk into my skin
it felt as if a layer of moisturizer was just sitting on top of my skin
i tried t during the day after washing my face
about 15 minutes after application my cheeks would start to feel tight
on the plus side
no need to dip your fingers into it
just press down along the sides of the white '
this goes on the back burner as something to buy during the warmer months
this smelled so bad i washed it off less than 2 minutes after i applied it
it feels tight after showering
it starts shooting the product everywhere
both times my face burned
it just makes my face heat up for some reason
go back to my origins make a different plus moisturizer
this face cream stayed greasy for a long time
it left my face looking greasy
it still made my face red after use
felt like my skin was clean after each use
you twist the cap
then you twist the cap again to have that hole plugged up
i felt like my skin was cleaner after using the other one
cause terrible break outs
actually has an odd push down dispenser so the product is pushed out a small hole
i wanted to kick up my moisturizering a notch
after using a whole jar
this cream made my face break out
i am not fully blown away by this product
i would wake up with them
i'll be searching for another eye cream
starting to develope fine lines under my eyes
don't push down on the top to hard because you only need a tiny bit
made me break out due to the excess oil it left on my skin
this one didn't knock my socks off
keep it in my nightst
when the pump pops back up
my face break out like crazy.
i literally had to wash my face mid-day because it felt so heavy
lounge around for a very long time before applying makeup or leaving your house
my work requires me to be in the sun most of the day
it made my face very oily later in the day
it just sat there in a greasy layer
my face stung after using it.
the makeup just rolls off
it felt like my skin was suffocating.
i usually have to go in a second time to get my makeup completely washed off
almost felt like a layer of product was still on my face
i just assumed that was all these great-for-your-skin ingredients actually staying on my face instead of rinsing down the drain
there was a ton of foundation that wiped off
don't count on it removing your foundation
then i started to see that it was drying my face out
i've switched to the oil cleanser now though
have switched back to face oil
left my face feeling clean and fresh.
the point of a face wash is to have fresh clean skin
as a face wash it does leave the skin clean
the lid cracked open- the bottle it's too heavy on the top
it's no challenge at all to lose well over half the bottle to your bathroom floor
i find it stings if it gets near the eyes
switching back to this br
it will go all over the counter
my acne has calmed down a bit
almost all of the product went down the drain
i cannot get the lid to snap back onto the bottle
a bit heartbreaking to watch like $45 of product go down the drain
it broke me out in little bumps everywhere
massage it in then wipe off
i like to splash water on my face before i wash it to wake my skin up
after letting the cream set for a little bit it dissipated
this seemed to make whiteheads pop up on different different spots on my face
the smell of my own face again
what an extreme disappointment because i think without that foul smelling
your nose is right there
the only way to get rid of it is to wash it off again
within a day or two cleared right up
i found out that my face is having all kinds of little red bumps
on top of it, it makes me break out.
my skin feels smoother after i put it on
defiantly won't buy another bottle because of price point
it does give my skin a nice flush after i put it on
woke up with bumpy skin all of a sudden
see if it lives up to the hype
both times i woke up with a couple new pimples
even after the whole bottle
now i'm having some problems with some pores getting clogged
i cleaned my face
tight which is if i use it after a while
my skin felt tighter on my nose
it turns a light blue on the face
you rinse it away
every single time i have used this product i have woken up with large
would go along with my regular routine
i am almost through with the whole bottle
am going in for a facial to tear winter off my face
my pores seemed to go back their normal size
left my face red
you can find you black head on your nose again
i wanted it to clean out the larger congested pores around my nose
definatley loosened up dirt
for my pores that only bother me when i'm almost smashing my face into the mirror i'm so close- it doesnt work really at all
each night before bed i dab the product on
do your body some good from the inside
it was recommended to me for dark under eye circles
i still wake up feeling like a grease pot the next morning
keep my fingers crossed
felt like i was just putting water under my eye.
thought not nearly as fishy as the sub-d neck cream
i find that at the end of the day my skin looks more lined than before
the product feels right on my face
i doubt i'll order again in this fancy pump bottle
wipe the product off that
i woke up with 2 blemishes
a few red spots that actually looked like burns
my skin is still on fire
i still had to wash it off my h
they also said it would get rid of old acne spots
my face just peeled
have to put moisturizer on top
no matter what i would wake up with patches peeling off my skin
it made me face burn
will look into a different scrub
needed something that would take care of them without leaving a scar
this one just made my face super red
this mask is all right.
when i awoke i had broken out with a few new pimples some bigger than others
my face begins to itch a little while later
this cream made my skin break out
i put it on my clean face this morning.
i am still healing from this disaster especially on my chin
after just a couple of weeks i began to notice a bunch of tiny clogged pores around my chin area
promptly went back to my usual oil-free moisturizer
the blemishes cleared right up
immediately had to wash it off
one night on the face
if i wanted perfume all over my face
didn't have to open the jar
i am 33 with fine wrinkles around my eyes.
there was no place on my body far enough away from my nose i could apply it
it made my face break out big time
my sun spots have not faded
after putting this on the smell was instantly unbearable
i tried to stick it out
even then there was a lingering fish smell
the scent goes away once applied.
i cleaned my face
i'll just use the rest as a night cream.
on the area under my nose
i hold my breath when applying
can they at least throw some rose petals in the jar
the smell lingered that i had to wash my face.
on my face i had to wash it off
products cake up on skin.
nights while holding my breath
decided to apply on a cold winter day knowing is have to re-wash my face after my work out
the smell was so pungent on my face a half-hour after applying that i had to re-wash my face
the hair on my face kept getting lighter on growing
then i soaked my face in it
i literally almost gagged putting it on
he told me people would think i have gangrene unless i washed it off
i still got a hint of it in the morning
threatened to sleep in the other room since my face smelled so bad
i will be staying away from this one
on my neck already
if you grew up near the ocean or a harbor it might not bother you
that i kept on gagging
had to wash it off of my face immediately
stays on the face forever
i tried washing it off immediately after applying
i applied it before bed
had to wash it off
face to try to cover the smell--it is actually turning my stomach
because the smell of it prompted me to immediately scrub it off my face
it reminded me of opening a mysterious tupperware container lurking in the back of the fridge
almost as though fish oil pill exploded
it also made my makeup slide around
toward the end of my first tub of it
some days it seems like it starts to rub against other products
i will be switching back to moisture surge though when i finish this jar
i used this along with the scrub cream
only tried it on one side of my face in place of my normal moisturizer
it made my face break out a bunch
i saw no difference on my dark spots after using this entire bottle
my skin tone is evening out
this worked to fade away my dark spots
it made my eyes water that was when i noticed that water makes the cream ball up which looks ridiculous
results in the cream being removed
my eyes start to burn
underneath or just underneath my eyes
i felt like my eyes stayed just as hydrated as it would with with any other drugstore product that i would pay half the price
it also made it burn around my eyes
went on my skin smoothly
and works well with make up.
my eye area is dryer than the other area of my face
have some fine lines by my eyes in addition to light circles under my eyes
brighter eyes are still a wish away
you have to barely use any to avoid your lids from sticking together
it did nothing for the dark circles around my eyes
my fine lines are still there
my makeup slides around all day when i put it on in the morning
hasn't helped with my dark circles or fine lines at all
when i put it on at night with the high resolution eye cream
idark circles are still the same shade
have had fine wrinkles around my eyes
i've had better luck with eye creams from the drugstore
it takes a while to sink in
what about the dark circles?
it takes away any puffiness i have
every time i wake up there's no sign of puffy or dark eyes just major dryness
ntense it kinda ate right through the other eye cream
i found this cleanser took off my face makeup pretty well
it left my whole face feeling tight
even if i washed twice
there still remaining stuff on my face
t's not gone even after being rinsed
was tight on money
some others have said it smells like baby spit up
it cleans my face well and has not broken me out.
!go ahead and bypass this one.
told me that i had to keep up with using it everyday
i used it til it was empty
the bags under my eyes stayed puffy
i do keep the roller in the fridge
it helps me wake up
made my puffy eyes get more puffy the next day!!!
my under eyes felt extra cool
i feel like it helps me wake up if i roll it on shortly after getting up
i am still in search of a miracle under eye product for dark circles
i like the way the roller feels under my eyes
made my make up crack
i noticed a deep wrinkle that had formed under my right eye
i never had trouble with the dark circles
when you apply this it burns under your eyes to the point where i had to actually take my towel
had to wipe it off under my eyes
this product burns under my eyes every time i use it
at first it felt soothing but now it burns.
bad sleeping leaves the lines resting on small bags
it burned the area under the eye
its hurt my eyes!
got in my eyes which stung
i mainly got this for the darkness under my eyes
i read someone else's review about how their dark circles ended up looking like bruises
turning them so red
it actually gave me wrinkles under my eyes after using it for just a week
had a couple of unfortunate accidents where i would wipe it into my eyes some time after applying
this one just feels like any other under eye roller with metal ball in it
it definitely woke up tired eyes up in the morning
needs to dry for a minute after you put it on
i put this on in the morning after i wash my face
my skin slowly started to breakout
now my face is covered with little red bumps
i will use the rest of this product for the rest of my body
purchased to put just on my cheeks which have been forever flushed for no reason
it barely made a dent in my on my dry arms
felt heavy on my skin
i think because of this it ended up clogging my pores
just use it for the rest of my body since i'm dry all over the place
i tried washing it off so many times
led to tons of white bumps all over my face.
my face cleared up within 6 days
then be supper stubborn
put it on my face
i still can feel it washing off my face in the morning
rather settles atop my skin
right after i put it all over my face
it got super red
i literally can't put it on my face again.
i couldn't keep it on for 3 minutes
it smells like a firework that was put out.
the other product was so thick it was hard to get all of it out of the ampoule
i am new to the whole flare-ups of flushed/redness
i get really red in the morning after i take a shower
it kind of lingers through the day
i give it 2 stars because it says its supposed to relieve redness on the face
f you have some spots in your face of capped cheeks
took away the redness though.
i do notice the morning after i put it on the redness in my cheeks is completely gone
when i follow it up with this the redness returns as i'm spreading it on
i tried a sample of this on my skin that had broken out pretty bad
turns me off to it
having it on my face
it didn't bring down the redness at all
my face burned again.
i apply this every night after i cleanse
i woke up with my rosacea bumps again after weeks of being without them
have noticed some fine lines around my eyes that i want to go away
every morning i woke up hoping to see smaller pores/skin peeling/red skin or any reaction at all
it seems to have evened out the color of my skin.
made me break out on my cheeks
it was like i was playing a game every night to see how fast i could get it from the dropper onto my face without the serum going all over my sink
its still sitting in my medicine cabinet collecting dust
i usually remove it with a cream or a wipe then go in with an oil to double cleanse
every time i pump it the liquid gets all over the bottle
i found myself wanting to wash my face before using this so not to spread around oil makeup
i ended up needing to wash my face after using this product to make sure all the oil was off
i found most of the makeup was still on my face
then wet your hands and massage face again.
have to clean up my counter
this made me breakout on my cheeks
i mean the tighten feeling on my face
since i double wash my face
i stopped using it and my face cleared back up.
breaking my skin out is a big no no
is usually shining by mid-day
my eyes would be watering like crazy
my face was kind of red after putting it on
while this does not keep me shine free
i found after 1 week of use it "masked" my face light red
the moment i put it on my face
after using the whole bottle
my face broke out with 3 large blemishes
in a matter of a couple hours i was shiny all over
this product made me break out in tiny pimples all over my face
made my skin break out
i wiped it off within minutes of putting it on
i applied it on my clean face
right after my cheeks turned out super red with an awful burning sensation
finished the jar in order to give the product a fair shake
the rest of my face is normal
i got this cream in a trial size along with the miracle worker pads-which i love
balls up-rolls off under foundation
i washed my face before bed like normal
get the product off of it
this product was so greasy and heavy on my face.
now my face burns every time i try to wash my face
now my face burns every time i try to wash my face
this experience left me hanging
go back to the bliss face cream
had to wash it off
use my regular eye make up remover
however, do need to clean up my eyes saperately.
it breaks up makeup
it does a fine job at removing my makeup
my face was covered in more oil than the exxon valdez spill
it left me feeling like i had a film of greasiness left on my face
i re-washed my face with a different cleanser afterwards
after trying the clinique take the day of balm
my face was clear in 3 days
so half way through the treatment there is nothing left on the brush or your face
seemed to break up my mascara
down my cheeks in a way that could not be easily removed
i still had to use micellar water to get rid of the rest of my makeup
how you can see the makeup "breaking up" on your face
there is this film over your eyes
i should've stuck with that because it cleared up my skin like nothing else
i would've been better off not washing my face all together
it really cleared that up
i wear a full face of make up to work
even after a makeup wipe this did not remove the last traces of makeup with two washes
could see everything it left behind
makeup left behind that caused that
following day i developed white heads galore :(
i just keep getting new breakouts
found that it did not clean my skin nearly as well as the clarifying cleanser
it left a lot of makeup on my skin.
my whole face is now covered in acne
it helped clear up my skin
bumps on my face
i got this cleanser because the sephora lady said it would clear me all up in 2 weeks
his company goes around giving this product 5 star ratings to trick poor unsuspecting pimply people
needed to wash it off
overall it did plump me up
i waa just trying to cut cost somewhere
however, i'll keep up with regime.
it had leaked all over the inside of the plastic container it comes in
the bottle had some kind of really sticky tape trying to hold down the pump part
so basically i was just walking around with a wet lotiony face all day
a lot of redness i was dealing with went away literally overnight
since it works well head to toe
when i used it at night i would wake up with a literal shine over my whole face
a good start for a teen just getting into skin care
by mid day or when i'm waking up
minus practically scraping the oil from my face
up to recently when i realized that my face is completely covered with blackheads
just take the cap off to use
my skin was back to normal
i usually just breakout in one or two spots on my face
test out the waters before you commit
after using it for 2 days i broke out on my chin like i never have before
after just two days of using it my face started to get really blotchy
my face become more oily at the middle of the day
the daily face cream ended up making parts of my face too oily
small complaint about packaging is that the pump stops getting out all the product after a short while so you have to scoop it out with the pump straw
after using it for a few weeks i have developed terrible acne on my chin
my face gets pretty shiny a few hours after use.
his are from lack of sleep.
it makes your under-eye area feel tight after 15 minutes or so
the best thing to reduce dark circles is lots of sleep
sometimes i wake up with huge bags under my eyes
if i put it all around my eyes
looking at myself in the mirror
i keep it it the fridge
this product burned my eyes so badly that i couldn't sleep after putting it on prior to bed
it gives a cooling effect the moment you put it on
then it just sits under your eye until it dries creating a slight clear layer
i still wanted an on-the-go eye moisturizer
who wants to use glitter on their face.
you still have over 2/3 of the bottle left
i think i'm going to have to venture out into other de-puffing serums
never made the puffiness under my eyes go away
in the morning when i wake up my eyes are very puffy
i still leave the house with puffy looking eyes
dark circles on nights i don't sleep well
i keep it in the fridge
i kept this in the fridge
back to keeping tea bags in the fridge for me!
sometimes wake up with puggy eyes
use two pillows instead of one at night so your head is slightly elevated
this will keep fluid on a downhill trek during the night so that it doesn't collect in your face
so to cover my face took 2-3 pumps
it took me a couple of days to figure out what was causing this uncomfortable problem
an my skin is starting to show some fine lines
so thick that i have to cut it with another product to smooth it on my face
i put the murad on before i put on my makeup primer in the mornings
once you get down to the pot being near empty
the first jar made me fall head over heels in love with this because i was getting those dreaded wrinkles around my eyes at the age of only 25
my skin happily drank up every bit of that eye cream
from time to time i feel a stinging sensation on my skin
for me, i woke up w/ a stye the next morning.
on the hunt for another eye cream!
my under-eyes are actually dryer then before
$50 and looks like i am going to be tossing it.
it does not aid in removing dark circles or fine lines
it did not plump up any of my fine lines or crows feet
the skin around my eyes got little bumps
left a sticky residue around my eyes when i woke up
it is really hard to put out cream hide around inside bottle
figured splashing my face with water
i will return this item as it broke my skin out in little white pimples
this stuff broke me out in tons of small little bumps all over my face
you can just keep foaming it up in your h
the smell does eventually fade
the smell is so putrid i threw the sample i had of it away
i try to sleep in this
the lid started cracking
i ended up having to throw away about 1/5 of the jar
it dries out the skin just giving it a hint of improvement
telling her my concerns for aging around the eye area
i feel like i put sardine oil on my eyes.
my cat won't get near me after i put this on
the smell does wear off after an hour or so
making a mess of my upper eye
it seemed to just sit on the skin even after patting gently for several seconds
fine lines under my eyes
can be worn under make-up with no problems
when i get home eyes are puffy.
just a little "freshening up" around the eyes would be nice
rested after using it
i wound up washing my face to get it off cause i couldn't go to sleep with that smell creeping up my nose
felt nauseous for a couple of hours after putting it on
stuck her nose right in my eyes
so after i put the eye cream on
makes me break out
the odor of fish at low tide was so strong it became an effort merely to motivate myself to open the jar
just to prove my point: the first time i used it my cat came flying up on the counter to sniff it
like if i'd applied straight banana boat spf or even an overnight oil under my makeup
my makeup slides off over it even if i let it soak in for 15 minutes
i only wear it when i go to the beach
my entire face turned into a pepperoni pizza
i realized that the pimples were never going away
by 10 am my face would be an oil slick.
it takes about 15 minutes for it to sink into my skin
also caused my skin to break out.
i can barely bring myself to finish the bottle
picked up a different daily moisturizer from another br
my skin is back to feeling uncomfortably tight
my entire face broke out in itchy red bumps
my face felt tight
this is a big thumbs down
had to wipe away little white specs the entire day
the residue only "shows itself" when i put my makeup on over it
the moisturizer tends to ball up even after being left on for awhile
i used it together with the entire boscia clear complexion line for six weeks
it makes a film on your skin that rolls off when you put on makeup
you rub them together
after trying the face wash
returning this and the face wash.
when i put primer / foundation on top of it
i stopped using it right away
left my skin tight
it causes my face to break out more than when i stop using this complexion line
hoping my skin would clear up
have not gone away
i've also gotten a few underground blemishes that don't want to go away
it also dried out my lips even when i only got the tiniest bit on them
i would have to cleanse my skin again
coming off into the cotton still
bought this face wash hoping it'd help with the big red blemishes i get along my jawline that would last forever
my face continued to clear up
when my skin usually clears up
it broke me out in little whiteheads
pollutants you pick up from the city
to top it off-- i started to get breakouts on my chin
this cleanser just never left me feeling clean
it causes lot of break out
when i use my tone after the face wash
i still had traces of makeup on my face
not down my neck
i break out from food i eat/stress
within an hour it would go back to feeling dry
this has done nothing for fighting/clearing acne
to put this on an oncoming blemish i expect something to happen over night or even a couple of nights in a row
this ended up clogging my pores
ended up returning it because even my drugstore face cream works better
help my small acne spots go away
i put this on after cleansing
and it kept producing oil until i washed it off.
my face stings when i put it on
this showed up under recommendations for a night cream
ed on my face it turned cherry red for like 20 minutes
i put it on too thin the first time
i felt like it pulled a lot of face hairs out
will keep my fingers crossed.
hot steam on my face first
it defiantly didn't blow me away
all it did was pull off several baby hairs.
when i peeled off the mask i was expecting a little more "gunk" to come off
stung my eyes which made me tear up
it does go away after 30 seconds or so
the moment i applied this mask my eyes were tearing up
none of my black heads were gone
i kept having to smooth it out
waited forever for it to dry then peel off
all it did was pull all the fuzz in my face out.
one finish that is different is it left my skin smooth
really red as if i had tape my face
my face still red
as well as when peeling it off
it also gave me a huge headache after putting it on
helped even out my skin
it pulled out my baby face hair
after seeing the black mask craze pop up on almost all social media platforms
throwing out the box
not much of the dirt in my pores was pulled out when i peeled it off
it turned out to be a waist of money
it also made my eyes water
when i peel it off it just pulls them to the surface making them more visible than they already were
when i got to the nose area only one clogged pore was on the mask
whatever you do don't get it stuck in the fine baby hairs around your face
i could see tiny hairs had been pulled from my face each time
the mask also made my eyes water despite keeping it away from my eye area
this went away as soon as the mask dried
my eyes stung like crazy
even after removing it by wiping it off with a warm cloth
then it barely peels anything off
when it comes to the peeling off
i've used up the whole bottle just
each time none of my blackheads appear to be removed when the mask is finished
although it does take off my dead skin.
this did not remove any black heads at all
i began noticing red spots all over my cheeks the day after i peeled this off
my skin felt like paper by the end of the day
after using it for a week i noticed the "glow" effect would just make me look greasy
aside from the pros i just cant get over the heavy scent
plus it blocked my pores and made me break out.
the product left a ton of shine over my t zone which is what i was trying to avoid
also along my jaw line
dry cheeks then stay away from this one
felt like i just dumped my face into the jar full of oil
started wiping it out
to me it is the same feeling of putting a thick
please bring back pure perfection
rolled up thingys on your face
just now noticing fine lines around my eyes
it did not remove/fade any dark spots on my face.
it absorve fast on my face
half of the serum would end up on the outside of the bottle as i carefully put the dropper back in
then left with an open hole in the lid
this gave me a burning sensation when i applied to my face
the parenthesis around my mouth were starting to look deeper
the fine lines in my neck are still there
this product pills on top of my skin rather than sink in
my face turned red from using this product
still get bad flare ups
seems to just sit on top.
i tried warming it up with my h
after washing it off though
it would have had to be an eye job in a jar for me to put up with it
went on to purchase black tea eye treatment by fresh
i could see it really soaked it quickly
i started to get little red bumps around the my eyes
had to mix it with another product in the daytime to be able to wear eye make up without it sliding off
the face cream was way too heavy
then my concealer settled in the lines
switched back to my regular moisturizer
it will make a good day time moisturizer for no make up days
then i put my makeup on over it
doesn't absorb into the skin its a very uncomfortable feeling i returned it the next day
in the morning i woke up with tiny zits all over my cheeks
right up there with ponds
it does leave a smooth finish
i ended up spreading lipstick
every time i use it my skin seems to be a shade darker the next day
then i started getting a lot of texture around my upper lip
turned into hard bumps that took a few weeks to heal with a stronger moisturizer
at first comfortable on skin.
completely broken out in little acne bits
it almost felt like i was putting body lotion on my face
after about 3 days my skin cleared up
she said it would instantly plump fine lines around the eye
first use i watched the lines under my eyes plump up
the skin under my eyes would feel tight during the day
got into my eyes
my jar is almost empty
i find it causes my eye make up to run
it started to kind of burn my under eye areas at times
by the time i got from my bathroom sink to my bed all the product had seemingly been absorbed which was nice
i actually use my nail to scoop some out
try to pat on around my eyes
unfortunately it made my eyes puffy the next morning
about five pimples along my under eye are where i never break out
it is basically a drugstore eye cream in a br
i end up using it all over my face
this does assist in letting product glide on better under the eyes
i accidentally got it in my eye when i was trying to wash it off
it just felt heavy on my face
i am still trying to get my skin back under control
i put it on clean skin at night
every morning i would wake up with my skin even more broken out
don't break out from it
or i may just use it on my chest and neck.
i ended up with a headache from the smell
i love this for a day moisturizer right now
i really liked the product until i noticed at the end of the day my cover up was splotchy on my nose
keep my makeup in place
it caused me to break out in places i never break out such as my cheeks
my skin started to clear up a bit
behold a new pimple on my cheek has started to form
my foundation just sits on it
first off the face base smells like lemoncello which is dope
i tried under my makeup
i wake up with oil slick face
kept breaking out all over the place like crazy
it smells like straight up pinesol!
i ended up using it on my hair
after applying this to my face it made me break out like crazy
for that i give it big thumbs up
feel the oil on my skin still over an hour after applying it
every time i use this cream under my eyes i wake up with tired
i could barely open my eyes in the morning since they felt puffy
i now have an eye infection
may have to try the extra moisturizer eye cream instead of this one
let it "sink in"
this cream seems to help my concealer stay on a bit longer before it starts to crease
set into fine lines
let it "set" for a few minutes while "expressionless" per the instructions
my entire face had those little white makeup flake/balls we have all experienced
until my whole face looked like it was peeling
or any other line or crease on my face
the creases are back
not moving muscles in my face
smoothing right before my eyes
no matter what the residue showed up relentlessly
'm not sure it has any benefit after its washed/rinsed off
hoping to help her get the regimen down pat
it takes my eye bags completely away.
it also took away the pits on my forehead like a miracle or in a dream
if you use it alone it leaves white marks
it will literally give you a face lift
once you start blinking or talking or moving your face at all
the spell will be broken
i tried many things: patting it away after it dried
once it's wiped off or touched by water
when i do re-wash my face
the wrinkles are back
left list of residue behind.
i wanted a tighten cream
messed up makeup and entire face rubbed off.
this was a big white mess
don't appreciate throwing money away for less
don't plan on wearing it with make up
you wash the product off
i put make-up on.
when you pat dry your face it goes back to the before state
i tried to wash it off
i just had to wash my whole face
my skin couldn't breathe after a week of use
however it looked amaizing by itself or with pressed powder on
when i pat it off
literally no difference at all
tried this on the outside eye corners
back to wear you started.
if i can get it to go away with a light light touch of water
once you put a different cream on to get rid of the residue the amazing effect goes with it
i put this on before i go to bed
i tried all the hints for getting rid of the white
it did pull my face tighter
this product takes away the fine lines immediately
when i wiped it off
the tube kept getting clogged.
i got tired of finding the white crust on various parts of my face through out the day
cant walk around with white streaks all over my face
knowing it would make my skin red
is why i started using makeup wipes in the first place lol
then my skin freaked out
it feels like water sinking in
for about 10 minutes then poof
the magic is over
my face finally just now cleared back up
for some reason without changing my face wash routine it made my skin more red
that smell made me take off two stars
makes me break out.
broke me out & left my skin extra oily.
i tried it one night instead of my regular moisturizer
it doesn’t make my face breakout
i woke up with greasy mess
it would just ball up and pill off.
what did end up staying on my skin felt greasy
as i was rubbing it in the product would pill up in little balls on my face
as i rubb it on my face it breaks up into rolls of the cream
it didn't glide on my face as smoothly as i want it
once i was in the sun
let it sit on your skin for 10-15 minutes before you apply make up
i am using it onmy neck
coming off your skin in little balls
the worst thing about it is that it balls up underneath my makeup
it still balls up on me
it does come in a convenient container—when you turn the top the pump dispenser pops up out of it
if it doesn’t work under my makeup
my eyes were just as puffy as before.
sephora has been stepping it up with their products
i can never squeeze the product out of the tubes through the roll-balls
even after i put it in the fridge.
just wanted to take away my slight just-woke-up puffiness
not breath taking results
while the roller feels nice after a restless night or an evening of partying
i wouldn't rec it to anyone... stay away!
this does nearly nothing for my puffiness with my eyes in the morning
i recommend putting it in the fridge
before the balls start to roll
i got it because it said that it can get rid of puffy eyes
especially after i stick it in the fridge
if i run my fingers over my face they are suddenly covered in white balls
if i can get away with not having these white balls all over my face it looks great under makeup
the two stars are because of the smell
i can't put it on at night before i go to bed because the smell will wake me up if i put my h
s too close to my face
i will us it on my feet
it dried out my face around my mouth
the oil free formula from the old one kept my skin in line like nothing else
it just sits there
the product left my face feeling so greasy
stay away from this one
my checks are burning.
i ended up with creases in my makeup
i would wake up with white flakes under my eyes
i wanted to take back the empty jar
seems to be helping with the fine lines around my eyes
i guess the intent is to avoid contaminating the product by putting your finger into the jar
isn't the end result the same as putting your finger in the jar?
then you have this little spatula lying around--where do you put it to keep it clean?
i will have to open it up to get the cream
be able to get deep under the skin
it seemed that my dark circles had become so deep purple
while putting on my makeup
in a rest room mirror
my make up otherwise held up great
my darkness under my eyes was so dark
on either side of my nose
maybe there is a "darkness before the dawn"??
i noticed a difference in my dark circles right away
reflects away from dark circles
only to reveal the cream is in a little bag around the pump
it applied just fine
unfortunately after about 1 month of using it it made my eyes dark
it actually made the skin around my eyes
or how well i patted
i felt that the skin around my eyes changed right away so every time i placed an order i choose this eye cream sample promo
i put it on the back of my h
on top of that it dried my eyes out
for a product that goes right next to your nose
the pump started losing its power to push the product out of the bottle
along with my normal skin care routine
stay away from this.
also a tip once it stops pumping you can manipulate it out of the bottle the cream is in a bag
you can't apply make up correctly it starts to fall apart
applying make up right after
there was no way to get the last bits of cream out of the packaging
can't open the bottle to wipe the bad boy clean
after pictures of my eyes
fine lines have almost dissappeared
scrape out every last drop
i am not asking it to get rid of dark circles or the crows feet
you can unscrew the top
pull out the inner bag--pull *hard*
don't try this until it is nearly empty
i then cut a small hole in the bag
i noticed after 4 days of using it twice a day that my face just felt parched
a lot a the product ends up being wasted
without pumping it onto the side of your h
hard to spread over my skin without serious rubbing
off to make sureit it causes me the problem
even then it takes a long time to absorb into your skin
find out the skin
ntense i got a bunch of them on my chin
the silver part you hold
my black blue still there the same colour
you end up wasting about 15% product.
whatever was left of the sample after that basically melted
i never break out around my eyes
lasting for a fragrance you put that close to your nose
sure left the smell on my face
also it felt heavy on my face.
i need to put another moisturizer over top of it
after waking up after wearing this over night
when i washed my face to take off my make up before bed
even one underneath my eye
i could see a difference in my skin the first time using it i woke up with a glow
my eyes do water
stay away from this if you're at all sensitive to scent
i immediately got a headache from the smell
pay attention when you first put it on as the lovely scent is taken over by the smell of alcohol
my dermatologist has always steered me away from any product with alcohol as it immediately dries the skin
the rest of my face didn't break out
i went to get a facial the other day
i ended up rinsing my face with water
get little red/raised bumps all over my cheeks
it works every day i use it making my face brighter
when i would wake up in the morning my pores actually enlarged
there is an area under my eyes
on top of my cheek bones that could use a little help
i'd silently lamented over it for a while
s off my face because sliding them along my skin felt sliding them along glass or polished marble
my last bottle is down to the dregs
on the side of my nose
the formula made my skin break out
have to put cream over it
on the bridge of my nose or my smile lines after 2 weeks of constant use
conducted my own "test" by putting cold plasa on the left side of my face
chin after not having any breakouts in months
now i only put it on my forehead
this would be on my neck and face.
my face was red
the bottle is now empty
i am in my mid30's with normal skin that is starting to show a few fine lines
it also tends to ball up under my foundation
stopped up the dropper
had to shake the serum out of the bottle directly into my h
this made my face break out
i made the mistake of straying from the face cream i love
put it on my face
i immediately washed it off
i will wait until the jar is empty
i'll let it run its course through the rest of the bottle
my face started feeling irritated
it pills up on the face no matter which product i use under it
then i noticed that the cream literally disappeared into this clear oil inside the jar
wears off after a while
i am still on the hunt for the right moisturizer.
apart from the smell
after about an hour or so i need to wash my face.
put this one away for another day
lifting cream all the time- day
it balled up when i put my foundation on over it
fine lines under my eyes
to try to soften the fine lines that are starting around my eyes
some mild steroid cream to calm it down again
night as an under eye cream
i decided i wanted to up my skin care routine by adding an eyecream
did not sting if it got too close to my waterline or in my eyes
has broke me out in my delicate eye area
bags under my eyes
it made the dark circles under my eyes not look /as/ dark
feeling tightening up right-away
i frequently wake up with the product still sitting on top of or "pilling" off of my skin
believe this runs into my eyes at night when i sleep
when i try to put my makeup on over it it became chalky
no go with make up which makes it only 3 stars instead of 5
let it "set" for a few minutes while "expressionless" per the instructions
around my eye area
as well as alone with a brush
the white finish shown thru my makeup
slip n slide nose after an hour
my entire face will glow like a ghost after 3 hours
try applying your make up
it burned my eyes so bad
they got watery until i washed it off
found the face tightener which looks just like this
it caused my undereye to break out
it also caused some creasing under my eye make-up
just patting it on quickly
still the residue shows up
once it's washed off
get it away, get it awaaayy!
my eyes were red
hoping to find something to minimize the fine lines below my eyes
makes your skin feel like its pulled in a vice
it is almost impossible to get rid of the white residue it leaves behind
it takes it off
it pulls the crepe right out.
under or with the firmx eye
this stuff does tighten up the skin under the eye
hid some of the finer lines around my eyes
i can only equate it to a crumpled piece of paper that you try to flatten out
still get the residue
if i wipe with water like they recommend then the effects disappear
it made my eyes look like they were peeling.
once i put my eye cream
make up on over the area treated with the product
make up over it
it takes away my bags
if i put eye cream over it the bags.
difficult to use because of the white residue: when i blot it away
if i put makeup on top
i tried everything to erase this
i tried everything wiping it
it tightened under my eyes amazingly
not under my eyes??
i find it worked best when i "patted" it into my skin as opposed to spreading it
it make my foundation slip and slide, instead.
it is my fault for thinking this because it just covers up the pores while you have it on
make up will settle in lines and pores.......
it made the foundation settle into my pores
it made my nose area break out
clinique really messed up when they discontinued their clarifying make up line
particularly with a little powder piled on top
running my finger over my nose
it made my face look all smooth
it was so heavy that i washed it off halfway through the day
when you squirt it into a cup of water the oil just sits at the bottom
i started to get some on my cheeks as well
i am getting a head start on the face oil thing.
as it feels like i am stretching my skin to get it to cover
within seconds i had a strange taste in my mouth even though the oil never came in contact with my lips
i didn't like the way it left my face feeling after massaging water in either
it really helped me calm down my pimples then after few uses
the pros: it removed make up well.
it took my makeup right off
once i was like half way through the bottle i noticed it stopped working to clean my face
so i now have to throw away half the bottle.
it left my skin feeling heavy
to top it all off, it dried out my skin so much!
then you're basically washing it all away
so you end up using like at least 6 or more pumps to clean your face
i try so hard to keep it away from my mouth
because you end up rubbing
light weight - when wearing alone3.
causing my makeup to slide around my face
/kids complain about it when kissing me on the cheek
just like the night cream
3 pumps cover my entire face
little bumps starting popping up on my t zone
my skin cleared back up
my face is my breakout prone at all
i am one to rub it all over my face since my lips could also benefit from spf
it burned a little whenever i first put it on
this lotion actually made me breakout all over my face
my face looked like i just splashed oil on it
aside from that it made me break out a lot in my t-zone
i applied this immediately after washing my face
i stopped and the acne cleared right up.
out came the ugly bumps again
the smell which lingers long after application is another story
it is just too thick to wear under my make up
i did wear it overnight
the only time i get pimples in when i'm about to start my girl time
can't wait for my face to clear up.
only felt clean after i washed my face
i could smell this at night in my sleep
feeling like i put perfume on before going to bed
i put it on mainly as my heavy night cream
got it on my lips on accident
it took forever to absorb.
by no means made the dryness go away
money attempting to get rid of
it did help brighten
i wanted something for the fine lines i have under my eyes in the inner corner as my foundation pools into it
i'd take results over a cute container any day
it does brighten up dark circles
even when it it almost absorbed into the skin if you rub your eye
brightens my dark under eyes in the morning really well
only minutes after applying my eyes felt dried out
it also burned my eyes
let alone fade dark circles like it claimed
nights underneath my eyes
especially in that area between my inner corner
i take off my makeup like usually before i go to bed
my eyes still have bags
dark circles were what i wanted to go away
especially right after i applied the cream
left me with red spots
my skin drank it up pretty instantly
it does not settle into the skin it leaves a sticky residue on top of the skin
give some firmness or lift to my jaw line
it mattify your under eyes
without any make up
love the little side window
i also like the little window on the side.
cover my dark circles under my eyes on the day of my wedding
: literally did nothing at all to my dark circles
it actually gave me these little fine white bumps under my eyes
i do close the cover
find that it just balls up
the cytocell is fine for evening use
it also seems to clog up in the pump
then what comes out is sort of dried up
my dark circles stayed dark
i've tried just about every "dark circle eye cream
it was ok to apply at night as long as i applied very gently
i tried checking right away
nstead of throwing the rest of the sample away
what it was actually doing was removing the dead skin off of my h
have had dark circles under my eyes for as long as i can remember
usually i just cover them up with makeup
it does help a little with any puffiness i had when i woke up
my circles are just as dark
i've tried a bunch of different eye creams from sephora
make up goes on smoothly
my fine lines have continued to creep
like every other eye cream i've tried
this one irritated one of my eyes so badly i had to take a break from contacts
ill give it 1 star because at least it hasnt dried up my eyes
this made my skin under my eyes sting.
i started getting fine lines around the eyes along with dark circles
put aside my sephora br
it's almost empty now
it still stings around the eye area
as a night eye cream that i can apply right before sleep so my eyes won't water
the burning/stinging sensation continued with each use
it felt like my eyes were especially watery the next day after having put it on before bed-time
i could feel product washing off in the shower the next morning
it made my eyes water
dark circles around the eyes
then after 2-3 days i started noticing little bumps around the corners of my eyes
i discontinued it right away
since i'm not blown away
just because i'm not blown away
got at least 1/2 a tube of air
not just right after washing
i ended up with foam in my eyes
am just getting to the bottom of the bottle
when i wake up my skin does have a glow to it which is good
i love adding them to my skin care routine
basically is just like slapping orange juice on your face
just sitting on top of it
i would stay away from this
although it did help lighten my dark spots
it also burns my eyes after i apply it
after 20 minutes of usuage my eyes starts to burn
just after a week of using it my under eye area is already less crêpe-y
my hunt for an under eye treatment with spf is still on
tears streaming down my face
aside from the package problem
some of it actually clogged the pores of my skin right on the border area between my under eye
it finds its way into my eyes
as i was scraping the last bits from the tube
transfers to just above my crease as well as below my eyes
my eyes started burning
i actually had to wash it all off.
i ended up returning--my under eyes are dry
this made that spot tingle in the wrong way
actually accentuates the tiny fine lines around my eyes when used under makeup
it stung like crazy
at the end it just crumbles on top of my eyes
it burned my eyeseverytime i put it on
the cream did not spread easily which forced me to pull the skin around the eye
i woke up with what looked like salt particles
after applying my make up
that during the first few uses my eyes burnt just a bit
pat it under the eye area
my guess is the contacts block the fumes given off from the cream
my eyes start to burn
tear within a matter of minutes
cover the whole area
then it starts to burn
my eyes kept watering
i am returning this eye cream.
only if you don't mind your eyes watering for the next 24 hours
not been blown away
my eyes were watering for hours after applying this
after i would rub it into my skin
the area around my eyes
once i put it under my eyes it stung a little
leaves her face feeling clean
i used it for 1 week it broke me out them my face was peeling like a bad sun burn
can easily go into my eyes
bottom line is that this increased my lid puffiness while doing nothing for my eye bags
burning when i apply it onto clean
i don't have fine lines or crow's feet
i see no improvement in the fine lines that are just starting to form around my eyes
this makes my eyes burn something fierce.
away from my eyes
it always finds a way to creep up within minutes
i wear it at night
the jar is almost done
when i wore it during the day it balled up under my concealer
over all this is the best under eye cream i have used to take away the puff under my eyes
it has done nothing for my dark circles or my fine lines
bad enough that the rest of the sample went straight to the trashcan
furiously itchy to the point where i could not sleep from the desperate urge to scratch my face off on the first night of usage
every time i put on this moisturizer my whole face turns red
it made me brake out
feeling tight like it was before
stayed out of the sun
i feel like i threw the money away.
it started to fade away
the ingredients made me break out
this product was recommended to me as a way to treat sun/age spots
making me break out
more time is needed to see if my sun spots begin to fade
i figured i could cover the redness up in the meantime
now not only are my cheeks red
i think at times it might have darkened the spots instead
i put it on each morning after cleansing
each night before bed
i immediately scrubbed it off with my regular cleanser
some people said they couldn't wash off the cleaning oil by h
i can use the evelom cleaning cloth to get the rid of the oil from my face
cant be washed away
rub it all over your face
don't count on it to remove eye makeup
i tried to wash it
i used a towel to get rid of it
it was a little odd at first bc putting balm on my dry face with a full face of makeup?
felt like i couldn't get it all washed off my face
ready for my face spray
then use a mud mask to get it off
i can barely use it to cover my face
then i found that this left a greasy feeling on my face
after using it felt like there was a layer of grease just sitting on my skin like a film
had to use another cleaner just to get it off
until i used a towel to wipe it
have to be wiped it
had to literally hold my breath while applying it
it lingered for a long time even when i washed my face
this has an off putting smell to it.
then it takes a while to be able to wipe it all off with a cloth
you have to wipe off the formula.
as per the instructions i am left with a greasy film which is horrible for me
before i could get rid of the residue
still dirty face i followed the instructions
it was hard to remove
i started to break out and it irritated my face.
it left my face feeling greasy.
even then i felt like i had a layer of grease still on my face
just chalked it up as apart of the cleansing experience
i'd recommend putting it on your feet as a foot mask
it heated up my face as it cleaned.
what i got was a jar of solid product that i had to scoop out with the spatula provided
it cleaned my face
it always left my eye makeup on
imagine putting crisco all over your face
then trying to get that off with water
it just beads right up
cleanse my face at night
cleaned the rest of my face without drying it out at the same time
felt like i was rubbing straight up oil into my skin
it can easily slip through your fingers
get lost down the drain
my face didn't feel fresh and cleansed afterward.
not leave my face feeling tight
even after make up
this cleanser was not good for my skin type because my face felt as if it was stripped after washing my face with this
even took off my make up however it left my skin very dry
if i wasn't concerned with clearing up my acne
shut them this seemed to irritate my eyes so badly
it still balled off
putting a different moisturizer on top
so when in the market for an overnight cream
it sits on top of my skin
plus i started to get small/pimple bumps on my face once starting this
did my normal morning face wash routine
when i got the jar i found the odor to be too off-putting
i ended up with 3 pimples on my chin in the morning
the mask ends up being all over my pillow.
also gave me white heads that i have tried so hard to get rid of
it gave me a big break out on my forehead which is a very rare problem area for me
the smell was so strong i had to wash it off of my face
it sits right on top
it instantly gives me a radiant skin almost gives my face a wake up call when needs it
i applied the mask over my face before sleeping
when i woke up in the morning i had to white heads out of no where on my chin
reminded me of the "fresh linen" bounce sheets
i broke out in tiny whiteheads all over my face by day 3
the hydration was just nowhere near enough
within 10 minutes i felt like i hadn't put on any moisturizer at all
they both are sleeping masks
add another thicker night cream on top
the perfume is so strong i had to wash it off
i woke up looking like a raisin.
every morning i woke up with flaky skin which i never had a problem with
made areas around her eyes
opening the jar usually stops me from putting it on
now do i wake up with "retextured" or "plump[er]" skin?
i am breaking out all over my face
i could feel the stinging almost immediately
this caused me to get little bumps underneath my eyes
the top of my cheeks after one use
i let my skin calm back down
wound up with crazy micro-zits all over the parts of my face where i was applying it
i used this in place of my normal cleanser followed by belif aqua bomb
added it back to my routine
it did get every last trace of waterproof eye makeup off
i do like the cleanse i got from it on my skin
left a film on my skin
it takes a lot to remove my makeup
it comes in one of those pump bottles that when you press down on it with a cotton ball it soaks it up
however when you go to close it you inadvertently pump the bottle
in order to close it with out this happening
close the top at the edge
(i may buy an empty bottle to put it in).
i wanted something that didn't burn my eyes like the oil base because it would stay on my eye lids after washing off
the bottle with the pump was a mess
especially at bed time
i mostly use it to remove makeup from my face
it worked well to remove makeup from the rest of my face however it left it feeling tight
i switched back to my usual cleanser
holding directly on my eye for a minute
have to wash it a lot afterwards
let it soak my eyes to get all of the make-up off longer than some other products
it makes its job in removing make up
after testing eye shadows in a nearby sephora store
using it to remove my full face make up with a clean make up remover pad
not something that knocked my socks off yet
it started stinging my eye area
every single time my eyes still look tired
when i wake up in the morning the circles under my eyes aren't as dark
i started trying the eye cream as part of a daily routine to "wake up" my tired looking skin
de-puff the dark circle/bags from lack of sleep
it left an odd sticky feeling on my face
the bumps just stayed bumps
it made my skin so red
when i washed my face it literally felt like my skin was burning
i took a break from using it until my face balanced out a bit
when i'm washing it off
when putting it on
after washing it off it left the feeling of a residue
my face was tight
makeup off my face
there that clear up quickly
my face felt clean
it's a good pick for a middle-of-the-line winter cleanser
i've gone through a bottle of this
when you put moisturizer on top it just peels right off
when i put a bit of toothpaste on my blemishes before bed it does the exact same thing
i apply it to any pimples that are on my face before going to bed
i put it on a new pimple overnight
instead i noticed that it was eating away at my skin
i then had a scab for a good 2 weeks with dryness surrounding the area that would not go away
when i wake up in the morning my blemishes are either the same or worse
not complete breaking out of my entire face
it stops working completely it just drys the skin out
i could've done the same with just washing my face
while this did shrink spots overnight
you have to squeeze the bottle to get the product out
i applied them to a clean face before going to bed
literally i woke up
it is more for random pimples that come up.
i also started breaking out in tiny whiteheads multiple times a day
feels like it sits on the skin as opposed to sinking in like the ginzing does
you can try to slow it down which is why i have been trying all sorts of "anti aging" "age-erasing" "fine lines
starting to notice those fine lines around my eyes
this one left my face super greasy
also love the night-a-mins night cream.
i put it on my face
my face still looked rather greasy after half hour
i think i'll start using it as a night cream on my face
part of my face would get this puffy red spot
the cream fits me with barely any breakout.
then i get some little dry spots coming back :
it literally keeps me from falling asleep because of how strong the smell is
when i'd wake up in the morning i had broken out on my cheeks
which surprises me because when i put it on before bed
spent 5 mins getting the cream off the cover
left my skinny very greasy even when i woke up my skin was still greasy
smooth in the morning
especially when i used it on my neck/chest
i applied it at night after my regular skin care routine
my makeup apply smoothly after i'd let it set for about 5 minutes
about 3-4days after i quit it cleared up?
it cleans my face just like something else from the drug store
it stung my eyes when removing my eye make up
i got out of the shower
my face would turn red
after two uses, my face hurt.
its sitting in my counter almost new.
it screamed "fresh face" to me
right now i use it as a body wash.
pulls out all the dirt
he washes his face about once a week
it broke me out around chin
didnt clean my pores out but made them tighter
it made me break out all over my forehead
it was difficult to wash off the mask
it seemed like it barely cleaned out my pores at all
when i washed it off
be very cautious using this mask because immediately when i washed it off i counted 8 breakouts on my forehead
when i washed it off
my face felt tight
over time i see that my pores
maybe try the rose clay mask
held my nose up to it for 5 minutes to open my pores
i tried to peel it off put ended up using a damp washcloth to clean it off
said it cleared their skin in no time
she has a huge red mark on her face that looks like a bee sting
it appeared right after rinsing this off.
it felt like it was stinging my face
when i took the picture i still had blackheads
first the mask lightly stung while waiting the 10 minutes to wash it off
after taking the mask off i realized my skin got red patches everywhere
my face did feel clean after
while this seemed to tighten them up
i would put this on my skin leave it for 10-15 min
perhaps because i haven't taken the time to open up my pores
i don't know why i keep picking it back up
i just happen to be one of the unlucky ones :/ aside from that
good for when sleeping.
it leave a film on your face
i only apply eye moisturizer in the evening before bed
i don't even apply close to my eyes
it made me break out under my eye area so badly
dry eyes it took awhile to figure out what was causing it
i notice it kind of cakes or balls up
even i used my eye to see cellphone a lot
read the back of bottles
beyond than my regular face moisturizer for my eyes
i only gave it 1 star because i got tiny white bumps under my eyes
no de puffing in the morning
i think i will go back to my kiehl's avocado eye cream after this jar runs out
decided to try this out after trying the ginzing eye cream
probably should've stuck with the ginzing
i noticed that my under eye area is so greasy after using this
this eye cream made my skin break out
i am in school pulling all nighters
i also found that the pores around my under eye were becoming clogged
i switched from fresh to this br
in addition to leaving my skin feeling tight
if you start breaking out more when you start a new face wash it's because it's bringing up all that dirt
philosophy clear days ahead gel cleanser
multiple times i've felt i've had to wash my face more than once to remove all the makeup
good to put in the shower for morning washing.
it made my skin feel too dried out immediately after using it
my face was not very clean after washing off my makeup
this face wash takes off my makeup
i ended up with with a mess of a face.
after the first wash my skin felt clean
this mask is fine.
if you're needing a quick burst of hydration
after i wash it off
i don't know deep down in my skin
definitely go for the drink up overnight mask instead
after washing it off my skin soon went back to being tight
each of them turn out allergies
i found that when i washed it off all the hydration seemed to wash off with it too
because i love the drink up overnight mask
i feel the same after i rinse off
it stays sticky for the entire 10 minutes
compare to when you take it off after 10 mins
this product is more like a heavy moisturizer when put on the face
i'll go back to the overnight mask once i finish this
once i wiped it off my face felt more tight
the minute i washed it off
to the point where your face shines
i woke up with the oiliest skin i can ever remember having
three strikes and it's out.
i can only wear this at night before bed
my skin is prone to break outs
it went on so smoothly
this cakes up your make up
i wanted a lotion that would help prep my face before makeup in the morning
well it left my t zone very shiny after an hour.
however my skin begins to look
within 2 hours i was a shiny mess again
my skin just ends up feeling tight again 30 minutes later
works well under make-up.
i basically had an oil slick on my face
i wanted to stray away from chemical-heavy products
it has been good for assisting in clearing out clogged pores on my nose
face acne has cleared up
tried it out on nose
just make it red
squeeze a little out on your finger first
fold the reynolds wrap tight around it then put that into a plastic baggie
used it after i started breaking out from forgetting to wash my face before bed a few times
especially their face wash
the redness did go away
putting that on your face
it also left my skin tight feeling in an irritated way
it couldn't stay moisturized on days where i needed make-up
i still get oily after couple hours with or without makeup
i run out of it so fast
once you open the container
when i washed my face i felt like the product stayed on the surface
feels so good cooling/soft skin/kept my oil at bay then i noticed all of my pores are filled with black
i outfit on my face after removing my makeup
i went to wash the whole thing off
because i just couldn't get over it sitting on top of my skin like a film
the "cooling" felt more like holding ice to my face
this residue would come off of it
it still left the same residue
right now i'm using smash on photo finish
it made my skin literally slick thought the day
it comes in a package that when you press down to get the moisturizer
it sometimes will stick while down
mine fine just got stuck for a couple of days
i hit the gym a lot
i think i'd go for a thicker eye cream next time
day 3 i started getting little tiny red bumps around my eyes
this is the only thing i switched in my face regimen
i also wouldn't recommend it if you have sensitive skin as my entire eye area broke out in tiny bumps after long term use
plus the contents are in a jar that you twist open
the product too close to my eyeballs
when i put this on underneath my eyes
only eure cream to make me break out
had little dots everywhere after i applied it at night
it does well with keeping the area around my eyes from getting dried out
decided to get this eye treatment to address my barely there fine lines
i typically wore this at night after washing my face
sometimes in the morning depending on how my skin looked when i woke up
i started breaking out around my cheeks
its hard for me to squirt out the right amount.
now i have to add another layer of moisturizer to avoid my face looking
it sits on top of my skin
it was only after i started the clinique 3-step system that my skin cleared up quickly
after my face clears up i will give it another go
sticky for about 30 min after you leave it on
if you plan on wearing this under makeup
the smell alone was hard to get over
then my face sticks to my pillow
when you wash it off
my make up flakes so much after just 2 hours of wearing it
once that effect went away my skin was dry
every day i woke up to a couple new pimples
i didn't mind that as i applied it at night before bed
this takes a while to soak into my skin.
i felt as though i had an extra layer of grease on my face
i woke up with new pimples
on the flip side
it caused me to break out into red dots all over my neck
i'll try poetry in lotion next after this is gone
the unnecessary plastic filler tube that goes around it both broke just a couple weeks after using
it flies back off
my skin is a broken out mess
back to the drawing board.
it made my eyes
the area around my eyes itch like crazy
i desperately wanted to stave off my
it rolls right off every time i apply any kind of make-up on top of it
by the last drop my eyelids upper
now i'm back on the hunt for a good anti-aging eye cream
it did help to lift my eyes lids
it will prevent crow's feet from appearing
i did not see any results on the eye lid
then my eyelid got all dried out
darkness under my eyes
afraid it will never replace eyelid surgery
if you want to put eye shadow over it
especially near the lash line
it felt irritating around my eyes
really see no liftingbof eye lid
f you don't have an issue with cones then go ahead
i still have to put on a mega moisturizer at night
i prefer products that sink right into the skin
how it warms up to touch
the pump mechanics got all gucked up with the product
being desperate to have something help with my acne
clean during the washing period
chest that needs the oil too
each time i broke out with spots all over my cheeks
as soon as i was finished with my nightly facial routine
that i had to put on lots of mist
my skin is back to normal
definitely no firming or lifting or extra-glow.
it made me break out badly
would tighten my under eye skin
dries up on the eye area, making matters worse!
i exchanged another eye gel for this one
it just isn't firming my lid area
ing full time job so my eyes need lifting
tugging when trying to apply makeup over it
there are some mornings when i wake up
what i like about the gel is that it absorbs right away
firms your eyes over time
i like this for de-puffing in the morning
the skin around my eyes started to get irritated
after a couple hours my fine lines under my eyes seemed to look worse
except the skin area near the side of my eyes
i don't want to throw it away because i've never spent $34 on a moisturizer before
on my desk it shall sit!
it made my eyes water.
after a few days after trying it i noticed that the pores on my cheeks besides my nose were huge
clears up a good amount of it
that cleared it up
i decided to go back to the korres 24 hour moisture for my day cream
i put on my primer
after about an hour, i started to see the shine.
it breaks me out
right when i put it on my face was stinging
just sits on top of the skin
after each use it caused my skin to get red followed by a stinging sensation
throughout the next day i'm just a massive grease ball
it just sits on top
it pills up as i rub it in
i got this in a set along with the extra eye cream
this goes on fine
on top of that this product irritated my skin
ended up throwing it away
thought it was just from the seasoning on the fish
the smell still lingered on my clothes
so strong that after tossing
turning in bed i decided to get up
everytime i use this at night the following morning i will have bumps on my forehead
i didn't finish the tiny jar on my face
the scent of this one is so strong i found myself waking up several times
made my face break out.
made my face break out
the main reason i baught it was to brighten up old acne marks
i woke up with small little bumps all over my face
my jawline broke out in a way that is not normal for me
it made it red
i weekly do a peel to keep my skin nice
if this comes back in the old packaging
bring back the tub
the amount of waste that will be left behind
i foresee myself having to cut open this tube just to reach the remaining amount
leaves a film on your face
this one gets a thumbs down from me
if you get the balm anywhere near your eyes
you have to be super careful not to transfer any of it to your eyes when wiping it off the rest of your face
since i always put on sheer face make-up
it removes well the face make-up
it left a film on my face that i had to wash off with my regular wash
this is good for pre-cleanse to remove make up.
remove eye make up separately
greasy feeling it leaves behind
when i put it on my skin
i still felt like a layer/film of the balm was still covering my face
loved the idea of cleanser that would remove all of my makeup without leaving my skin feeling stripped
i loved everything about this until it burned my eyes
unless i find a way around the burning sensation this is going back
dryed my skin badly after about a week of using
it also stung my eyes
i couldn't put up with it
just had to get it out of my bathroom
how the can clogs up before its empty
still have fine lines
product i am getting out of the bottle
since it sprays air for the first few seconds followed by a stream of foam you are instructed to "rub in immediately
before applying on the other side of your face
the rest is preasurized air
it started to ball up a little
my skin has actually been causing me to break out
i tried wearing my usual powder foundation over top
it made the makeup settle into pores
after a few nights of gagging as i put this on my face
i literally had to wash my face 5 times to get the smell out
i couldn't top from gagging because the smell is right there under your nose
stay away unless you have a strong stomach
i plan on using up the jar
falls off your fingers
i finally solved the problem by pouring it from the jar into my h
once i get through the jar
it smelled like laundry that had been left too long in the washer
just to chance things up
going back to ptr line
the smell of this was so off-putting
into the garbage it goes.
i washed my face not even 2-minutes after applying
in case my skin just needed to acclimate
it doesnt break her out
i managed to spread it on my cheeks fine
i didn't want to put my fingers back into the jar to get more
it tingles when first applied
felt like it set on top of my skin without ever absorbing
the product is being repeatedly being exposed to the air which in turn breaks down those ingredients
i also noticed my skin peeling off every morning i wake up
as soon as i stopped using it my pores cleard up.
my issue is that this face creme burns when i put it on
it until it wears off
i stopped using hope in a jar because of the smell
the stench does not go away quickly-- i put this on after showering
it left creases in my fine lines even though i used it lightly
by morning i think it had rubbed off on my pillow
would really take away the shine
before i even finish applying my makeup i already need to use blotting papers
you get home open the box
it sits in my pores after too
it would keep my skin oil free for about 2 hours.
even when i only applied this product onto my face without makeup
just on the fence about the shine control
my face was just as shiny without it!
my makeup stays shine-free all day
started clearing up within a day.
keep oil at bay
first off, this stuff smells like dog breath.
got into every single fine line
showing off my imperfections instead of hiding them
just don't get too close to your water line
dark circles i have under my eyes
the only thing that occurred under my eyes was a mentholated feeling for about 10 minutes
helps wake-up both me
my eyes when i'm tired
it made my eyes water
i wear my life under my eyes
i love the idea of a stick balm for under the eyes
i put this in my fridge
no sting at all
i roll it in a circle around my eyes once a day after cleansing
then when you twist the product all the way out of the container
it honestly is barely the size of the end of my pinky to my first knuckle
i got talked into buying this de-puffing eye balm
makes my under eye make up wear off quickly
this really burns my eyes when i apply it too close
then causes little red bumps
few wrinkles around my eyes show when i smile
then it starts burning
burning sensation goes away after a while
i get pretty puffy eyes the morning after i'm up late
i even tried sticking it in the freezer
applying it before bed
it knocks off some of that morning haze right away
to be honest i am stuck on the size
i don't see much happening in the de-puffing of my eyes in the morning
within a minute of putting it under my eyes it started to burn
my eyes where so irritated with this product!
look in the mirror-nothing
menthol like fume was so strong my eyes stung for about a half hour after applying
i put this under my eyes
this product had no affect on the bags under my eyes
i ordered this as a step up from my usual clarins night cream when sephora stopped carrying it
i got a pimple after using it once
i've also already broken out on my nose.
that i had to wash my face
left skin immediately feeling ok
if possible stop the fine lines forming around my eyes
it didn't plump up my fine lines at all
not a %22get this off my face burn/tingling%22 feeling
this mask warms up the face like many other masks
it burned my skin so bad that my skin burned for days afterward
then showered the way i normally do when using a mask
left on my towel
halfway through the bottle the pump completely stopped working
after about a week i switched back to my skin tone correcting moisturizer
just t-zone shine part way through the day
even after 30 min to let it 'set'
it looks like i have gone days without washing my face or putting any product on it whatsoever
messing with my makeup application
i do think it balls up under my makeup
best to wait a good half hour at least for it to sink into the skin before applying makeup
i've got a pretty stripped-down
until i wash it off
my bottle is over
in fact i am seeing one more line on my forehead.
lip lines were "almost gone"
i should have stuck with just the "good genes".
it got rid of the redness she had on her face
sadly i get little white heads the next morning.
got the kit that came with the small sample of this the moment i put this on my face it burned so bad
my face started turning red within about 5 seconds i had to wash it off right away :
this product cleared up some of my pimples
a little bit of fine lines on my smile line
woke up the next day to splotches that were still there
my skin was a little red after wards
i took a trip down adolescent lane
dreaded the odor that came along with the product
let it sit for a few minutes for deep cleaning
my skin is breaking out like crazy
i like to wash my face while in the shower
face feels the right afterwards.
the smell is a turn off
wasted a lot just trying to wash my face
switched back to philosophy purity my skin is balanced again
has to be shaken before every use
each time i end up using another cleanser to really clean my face
it seems to just push my make up around my face.
still needed a third wash with another cleanser because makeup was still on my face
it cleaned okay but defiantly not for the price.
there is almost no grime left on my face than if i where to use my old cleanser
i ended up using my other cleanser
water on your face
the claim of a "clay cleanser" i was hoping for a deep clean feeling
this really felt like i was just splashing water on my face to clean it
after 3 uses ended up with white heads on the apples of my cheeks
then rinsed off could make a difference that is worth $45
keeping it clear for months now
shocked to wake up in the morning with over 20 tiny whiteheads
i breakout with big red pimples the morning after use
also didn't like that the cleanser separated in the bottle
feeling bumps/breakout along my jaw line
then down my neck :
quit applying on my face
i've had to change up my routine
it worked right away
the "weak" scrub caused my face to break out something awful
my face cleared up a little bit
my face cleared even more
now that my face has cleared up
made me break out along my jawline
peeled off if i touched my face
onward with my search for a solid night cream!
can throw it away
ends up on my phone
you have to pat it into the skin
the directions on the bottle said to use something like 5 drops
my advice is to use one or two drops at a time or you'll end up spreading it all over my arms
but, this made me break out all over my face.
when i wake up it is completely absorbed
it seemed to never absorb into my skin
i am sitting here at work after using it just once with red puffy eyes
does a decent job of filling in fine lines on forehead
when you put it on it reduced the look of the line
have deep lines under my eyes
have tried everything to get rid of them
red the box turned out it was to be used under make up to reduce visibility of fine lines- not what i wanted
still on the hunt for something to help my frown lines
the tube is almost empty
there was no fill or puffing of my wrinkles
i switched to take a deep breath
it caused my chin to break out like crazy
i would put apply both on after cleaning my face
i noticed if i didn't use the clear days ahead moisturizer
my acne cleared up about the same when i was only using the max complexion pads by themselves
my face was broken out in lots of little bumps
most of it ends up spilled out of the tube
you're constantly having to shove excess product back in
it made the area around my nose
i continued to use it hoping that my skin would calm down
i frantically tried to wash off my face
clearing up/keeping clear
only open it upside down
just bough this for the occasional breakout
i now use tree tea oil i notice results after one night
my face got red
my chin looks like a warzone right now.
or even if i put a layer of it as in the directions over an affected area i would go to sleep with one pimple
wake up with three
worse the skin took 4x as long to heal once the pimple went away after a week
as your rub it into your face it starts to smell like feet
applied it on a clean face
it always peeled away once it dried to my skin
i'll just stay away from sephora br
gave me a bit of a headache while wearing it
i picked this up yesterday after going through 2 bottles of the instant moisturizer
made my skin itch as soon as i put it on my face.
i switched it out for the mattifying one
it wears great under make up or alone.
this product is hard to push aside.
it was cooling on my eyes
the gel felt as if it was pulling my skin while sticking to it
ended up cutting it in half so it laid flatter.
didn't pump up my fine lines or took away my puffy dark bags
did nothing for my dark under eye circles
since this mask covers the whole eye you have to just sit
rest with it on
seems wasteful to throw it out after the first use
this eye mask is one that goes over your eyes
i admit i thought i was purchasing eye mask for just the under the eye area
i will stick for the face masks from now on
i woke up with puffy eyes
stick it on your face with your eyes closed for 15 minutes
there are no eye holes so you must close your eyes
basically you take a 15 minute nap!
i am starting to get a tiny sag on the lower rims of my eyes
i still keep going back to a small bag of crushed ice wrapped in a thin towel
i started searching for eye treatments after noticing my stubborn dark circles won't go away
i put it in the fridge overnight
i tried the instant depuffing eye mask today
i still have bags under my eyes
i don't know how long i left the mask on because i forgot to set a timer
it didn't lay right on my face so that the area right around the eyes wasn't covered unless i held it in place constantly with my h
next-morning or at the end of a long day tiredness situation
maybe this is just it breaking out my skin before it clears up
bought it right away
it let me down
got this to try to get some clogged areas cleaned up
my skin started breaking out with lots of oil
tip: it doesnt run out fast <3 i used 2-3 pumps for my whole face
still have a decent amount of product left in march
then my hormonal acne came back with a vengeance
this product made my skin break out like crazy it took me over a month to get my skin back to normal despite its claims that it has no oil something in it made me break out i have acne prone skin hormonal acne
'oil free' to have a light feeling on my face
make up don't go on as nicely as they used to
my face feels sticky right after putting it on.
i've had to literally break the pump to squeeze the lotion out
it stung when i put it on my face
apply make-up in the morning without washing your face again
i don't pick it up
other face makeup moved around
even with some extra time to soak into my skin
-kept me matte- it was almost overwhelming for my skin
i only needed to use them on my nose
then it rolls up with any other product you put on top
one of the tubes to try out
this product just sits on your face
it seems to just sit on my skin after i put it on
i don't care if it were to magically take 20 years off of my face
the smell gave me a headache
got this in hopes it would help with my redness.
i should also note that the idea is to pat this down to the collarbone
either way it made my hair very greasy each time right away
my clothing even after an hour
it just sits there on top of my skin and smell.
i ended up using this mostly on my legs and hair.
when i wake up for that extra moisture
the oil itself was fine
floral sent people around me into fits of sneezes including myself
then it started to make my forehead completely break out
smell starts out just gross
once it is on your hair
weighs it down just enough to tame fly-aways
the scent was a major let-down
makes my face break out
it kind of sunk into the skin
a half to repair the damage my skin got after just one thin application of this
this will make it all flare up!
it fixed my skin right after i got out of the shower
nice until the next day it was a constant use of the material to keep my skin feeling smooth
the second i washed the mask off from my face
the area where i put the mask on got so red
i constantly wanted to put it in my mouth
my face ended up red and raw!
after 30 minutes i was already blotting
it seems like my oily skin will come back really fast by noon
easy to wipe out all
it actually ended up completely drying out my forehead
will use it until it's empty
at night time i washed my face
got rid of this immediately
my skin cleared up
after using it for a while i started getting white bumps on my face
it made me break out all over my face
literally the only product that's keeps my face from cracking
those annoying mid day flakes from popping up
i really wanted to try the other caudalie cream with the green cap
i should have gone with my gut.
i woke up the next morning with tiny bumps on my cheeks that weren't there before
kind of just sits on your face
it also burned my skin when i put it on
it's taking almost 10 days to repair my skin.
then it just felt sticky
made me break out badly :/
warm water ready to go before applying the first time
it calms down after an hour or so
the sensation always goes away without me washing it off
is there a product out there that works for dark circles under the eye for black women?
rather on my fingertips
when i look in the mirror i look tired
my eyes are still dark
gave this under eye corrector a try
however after after letting it on my skin for 30 min it still felt greasy
i even kept it in the refrigerator as adviced by the lady in sephora
i look more awake
oh well back to the drawing board.
my desperate search for a product that could get rid of my dark circles
this does not help with dark under eye circles at all
even when i set it with a powder
it will get into your eyes
goes right into your eye
after putting it on
had to put my other concealer on top of it if i wanted to cover my dark circles
have ask ways had dark circles under my eyes
a lot squeezed out at once
it only comes in one shade
it is more like a cover up then something you use under make-up
i should have stuck with that
i would have trouble with fine lines at the corners
i started to develop tiny bumps under my eyes
the bumps went away
my dark circles are still dark.
the scent is quite off-putting
i woke up with more oil on my face if anything.
after trying another beauty product that obliterated my face
it helped soothe a terrible break out
it also takes a while to sink in
i wake up greasy looking
my skin is still recovering
that it would melt right into my skin
after 25 minutes of the product failing to soak in
my face feeling like it was being smothered
i decided i needed to cleanse my face
the blackheads that i had worked so hard to get rid of had sprung up all over my cheeks
save yourself the trouble
it made me badly break-out
i kept using it thinking that my skin was purging
then at around day 4 of nightly use i noticed that my t-zone had more blackheads than usual
i still have the dark circle around my mouth
a dark spot on my four head from a breakout that i've been trying to get rid of didn't see any brightening at all
this caused me to break out all over my face after one use
retinol is supposed to be away from air.
my skin was fine
well it made me break out with lots of small zits in my t zone after a week of use
$88 dollars down the drain
it kept my acne under control.
it didnt remove one mark from my face
it did fade fine lines
the spots on my skin have not faded at all
the next day i woke up i had all tiny white pimples
when i tried to wash it off
it kind of clung on to my skin
too much comes out so i had to take the lid off.
i usually jump the gun with reviews
get excited without giving products a few days to settle with my skin
finally as an overnight treatment applied to problem areas
it seems to make the zits turn into a dark red spots when used overnight
i've actually woken up with new outbreaks sometimes
even after you've slept in it overnight
also fades away pretty quick
i tried this after falling in love with the moisture rebound cream
it made my skin break out
once warmed up would soak in to my skin
my face was white as a ghost after applying this.
i like that when i wake up in the morning my face is still moisturized
lots of money for a neck
this cream clogged my pores to the point where i had a full on reaction which is still trying to heal itself
look like i had no sleep at all
helped lighten up new/old acne scares along with reducing the amount of dark spot/freckles
helped plump it up some
it made the dark spot spread out
i didn't go out into the sun during treatment.
i just started putting it directly on my face to avoid that fall out
sometimes i would develop one or two white heads the end of the day after this at night time
the product ran down my fingers before i got the hang of how to dispense
i wanted to help with the fine lines i'm starting to notice under my eyes
a nice wake-up scent for my morning routine.
i could not get my make up to go on evenly
have to go to bed right after i use this
it did instantly brighten up my eye area.
my eyes started tearing up
irritated the sides of my eyes to the point where my eyes would water up
bumps popped up on my eyes
off through out the day
my eyes kept watering
her eyes stung like crazy too
disappears as soon as the product is removed or washed off
every single time i apply this no matter how small the amount or careful i am it ends up burning on the inner corners of my eyes
had to get out of bed
wash it off because it kept me awake for 1/2 an hour
were sometimes red at the end of the day
after i wash my face
my eye would tear up for about 5 minutes
wanted to try their eye cream
it runs into my eyes throughout the day
making my eyes burn
i put it on right away in the morning to let it dry before doing my makeup
also, it really stung and burned my eyes.
i broke out with little red dots under my eye after a few uses
i though this product was alright at reducing dark eye circles
within 6 hours my face broke out into a million teeny tiny pimples
i keep putting this on those"puppet mouth lines" that are on the sides of my cheeks nearnose
tight when it had sunk into my skin
still had flakes all over my face :-
it made my face sweat as soon as i put it on
it caused me to break out badly
made my skin break out
i love using this for my toes and legs, however!
i feel bad for spending more than $10 on this product as i've ended up quickly repurchasing a korean moisturizer to fix the mess this has left behind
clean all day with no irritation
caused me to break out in little pimples all over my face
my face was stuck to my pillow all night.
as winter is rolling around
it sits in a corner in my bathroom collecting dust
it sunk into my skin quickly
the next day there where zits everywhere
after completing the jar my skin felt little irritated-red after every use
hammer to destroy the lid to find i had at least two weeks or more product left
it made me break out with tiny white heads
about an hour after i apply it my face looks
there is no way to get the lid off once the pump does'nt get the product out
i gave the rest of the product away.
all it did was make my make smear off my face within hours of applying
will continue using this until the jar is empty
wakes you up in the morning
i stay hydrated all day without the heavy build up
it made my face break out bad.
i never had broke out like this before several large tender bumps all over my chin area
cheeks near my nose that never came to a head
my skin is back to normal
if you apply makeup or another product on top it just rolls up on the skin
the smell was a little off-putting
every time i use it my skin breaks out
it closed them so tightly that nothing could get out
all-in-one night treatment for my skin
there were pieces of leaves
i finally bite the bullet
you have to wash it off
as for tightening the purple mask from glamglow does a better job
only down side is it dries up in the pot
"fight through the burn"
it burned so bad i had to wash it off after two
i couldn't put in on my face unless i used water on my fingers first
i put this mask on
before i even got to the other half of my face i had to wash it off
aside from the dead leaves
first off i did not like the huge chunks in this mask
then instantly started burning
it took almost a day for the redness to go away completely
no matter how i washed my face afterward it was like there was a layer of s
a lot of bumps started to apear on my skin
my skin is just now starting to clear up
i prefer an eye cream that has a pump so that i'm not having to put an applicator that has touched my skin back in the bottle
well it wasn't- it made the skin under my eyes red from usage
my eyes have beginning stages of lines
twisting in too many directions
made the area around my eyes tight
if i apply in the morning i feel like i have to put on some sort of foundation or powder to cut down the shine
my face would break out
switched back to my regular products until my face cleared up
i really wanted to be blown away by this
skin care or make up
left my face feeling very fresh
it was a chore to try
remember to put the stuff on my face before i used water
i always have to use another cleanser after i clean my face with this oil
had plenty to wash my whole face
left an oil feeling on my face
i now have a $60 bottle just sitting there on my sink
this product has found a home right next to the toothbrush
i find it to heavy for day wear
press it onto your face for a few seconds
it also soothed her skin after all day out in the sun
i did not enjoy the sticky feeling it left for a minute or so after being applied
then started to turn concerningly hot
washed it off then my face turned bright red
the bottle is nearly empty.
occasionally challenging to get from my finger to my face without losing some to the counter
the next morning there seems to be a film residue that comes off in the shower
i don't have the same experience when i wash my face before bed
the area around my nose is still red
there is no way to open the jar
scoop the rest out
my acne finally healed
it even makes my dark circle under eyes less red.
i'll just wait till my skin heals for the redness to be gone
after i wash it off
maybe one day the fine lines
the white stuff was stuff that kept producing out of my eyes due to the product aggravating my eyes
no help with dark circles, lines, lifting, etc.
i did get a bump under my eye
thank goodness the wrinkles went away
lines under my eyes
what disturb me was my dark circles was getting darker
the next morning my under eye area felt smoother
still on the fence .
my issue is under eye dark circles
it burns my eyes so i returned it.
thankfully sephora's return policy rocks
the brightening mud on the rest of my face
every time i have been left with a red burning patch of skin afterwords
i left it on about 5 min
this burned so bad to the point where my face felt numb
i'll just stick with my other masks that don't try to burn my face off
it tingles a little at first then dries
it came unopened with chunks breaking up the wonderful smooth consistency
after i put it on this mask
washing it off i had a flap of acne in the exact areas i put it on
then the next day my skin started peeling off.
as soon as it touched my skin i felt like it burned my skin
i should have taken it off right away at that moment
when i took it off everywhere where i put the mask was red
i even had to put ice on my face
i am so upset cause my face won't stop burning :
noticed these tiny white heads around my t-zone started showing up that weren't there before
it also has a unpleasant odour that threw me off.
once i wash off the mask my face looked the same right after
leaves my skin glowing but next day i break out.
when i rinsed off my face it looked like i had a red mask left on
taking wet dirt to put on my face
i wanted to rub ice on them
my face was red everywhere i had put the mask.
after i took the mask off my face was bright red.
my pimple should of been gone along with the junk that it pulled to the surface
noticed this got stuck into my pores
then the next day i had a pimple on my cheek
refreshing when putting on
it'll sit on top
eventually just peel off
it's on the lighter side when i apply it after cleansing before bed
when putting on foundation
when i first put this on my face after showering
this took upwards of 20 minutes to finally soak into my skin enough for me to do my makeup
they clear up almost immediately after i stop using this lotion
when i don't wear make-up with it
i figured if i fight the dryness it would clear up my face
i should have stocked up on it when i went to my local sephora
noticed they had to open up the bottom drawers just to find this particular non-plus mad
i can only use this as part of my morning routine where i don't need a thicker cream for my make up routine
at night i am on the search for something thicker
my still was still greasy after using this product
that i usually do a full face blot at least 4 times a day
i ended up having a few pimples pop up
causing me to have to wipe everything off my face
start over again with a different primer-type base
the product doesn't roll off as badly as when applying a full face of foundation
this product worked to help control the shine for maybe an hour
then use a powder after applying your foundation
the man was very convincing on the fact it could keep me shine free
i wash my face at night
get on with the day
everywhere i had applied it
i've seen my cheeks get pretty flush before
when he applies it after he washes his face it keeps oil at bay for only a couple hours if that
water on his face does
seal in hydration" however it only felt like i had a greasy face
made me break out towards my chin
i swear after awhile i was convinced i was just slathering straight up cooking oil on my face
but... i woke up the next day with pimples!
now i apply it on my legs after waxing
we practice twice a day which wreaks havoc on your skin
my skin was flaking off from when i woke up to when i went to sleep
i woke up with a pimple
it feels heavy through the entire day
it would leave oil on my pillow and my clothes.
the oil bottle's lid fell to pieces halfway through too which was annoying since it was so expensive
am still using it every night before bed
smooth when the cream is off though
i don't have fine lines around my eyes though
woke up the next morning with a terrible allergic reaction all over my entire face
it does take a while to sink into the skin
seemed to make my skin red
left my face looking shiney all day
i've gone my entire life without breakouts
its stayed sticky on my face
then it just disappears
i've returned back to my old drugstore moisturizers until i return this for something else
when i put my makeup on over it
it breaks me out
my skin had just started clearing up
anything that feels greasy on my face is an immediate turn off
instead of tossing it i started using it on my chest
can get rid of them
and that is where this cream comes into play.
bags under my eyes
about a week after using this stuff i also had a bad eye infection
after using the whole tube
got this eye repair cream in a set
stung my skin so bad that i had to throw the whole bottle away
areas away from my eyes
the irritation cleared up once i stopped using the cream
while i try to keep it mostly away
if i put it on at night i wake up looking like i've been crying all night
it definitely goes deep so take care to avoid the lids or close to bottom lid as the cream will burn so bad
just a little stinging sensation
it left me feeling like my eyes had been bruised.
this burned so bad i had to wipe it off immediately
started adding it to my face cream
it was too unbearable to deal with
that goes away quickly
the irritation does eventually go away
eye cream hoping to fight the little wrinkles forming on my face
i don't have fine lines my do have darkness under my eyes
it seems to brighten my eyes up a bit
it makes my eyes water when applying it
i am 45 looking to reduce the lines around my eye area
it did slide into my eyes
i washed it off immediately
on the plus side
unfortunately i've used the entire tube up
i used this diligently for about three months straight on a scar under my chin
its easy to put on with the roller ball.
see pictures below- day one
i applied a fair amount on my leg twice a day because there are a few mospuito bites which left ugly dark marks
have to wait for 10 minutes before i put on my pants
i keep rolling it over
over on my face
when i put sunscreen on over it immediately got into those little crumbs that get all over since the product never absorbed
the rolling ball made ease of use though.
it seemed kind of counterproductive to usea product to clean up scars from former acne with a product that just gave me more
ended up asking about treatments for my acne scars
then put on my moisturizer
when i put on my foundation
it started to sort of peel off
if anyone can suggest a second moisturizer to layer over top that won't break the bank
my skin never absorbed one single drop of it.
after awhile that feeling disappears
its been causing me to break out too.
for some reason it irritated my cheek-bone area to the point where if i cleaned my face
remove my make up it burns from being irritated
my face became so red like it burned my skin even if i put it on according to the direction
once my skin stops burning
i find that my face feels tight after using it
it balls up as soon as i rubbed my primer on my face right after
i may continue to use as a spot treatment of sorts on my chin at night
i mean i have to brush off my face every time i put makeup on after
it would just ball up
in the morning when i washed my face it felt like slim was coming off my face
it started burning less than a min.
on the plus side
my face would turn red when i applied it after showering
it didn´t break me out
it goes away quickly
i've noticed every time i pair it with a bb cream or tinted moisturizer things start to ball up
it leaves behind little pieces of the paper towel
i also had a few pimples come out which i chalked up to my product trials
it just sits on top of my moisturizer not tightening pores like it claims
i see it tighten my pores right after i put it on
i feel like i've just flushed $75 down the toilet
not only that my eyes look like i've ended up with wrinkles
i ended up with flaky skin around my eyes.
i tried applying lightly just once a day
redness in the mornings so switched to every other day for a little while
the product dried out my eyes even though i followed up with a moisturizer
it gave me more lines under my eyes.
i'd wear it under makeup
then it thinned the area around my eyes
thought i should get one to help with fine lines around my eyes i saw literally no change after using the entire tube
then follow with my eye cream
under eyes still the same.
when it started to sting very badly upon application
now the skin around my eyes feels tight
now i have a red burn all around my right eye
i'll make it through the bottle
actually made my under eyes look crepey and old.
i keep waiting for the skin the slough off
i used this product for about a month until i just gave up because i noticed that it did nothing to get rid of my under eye dark circles or bags
i tried this out in the tarte wide awake set
if this product helped with my dark circles
making my eyes water
all in all, this is an ok under-eye cream.
after using a whole jar
not in the morning under my makeup
of the area around my eyes
at night after applying this eye cream
water starts pouring out of my eyes
my under eyes still looked dark
it does brighten up the undereye
it does not fade away the dark circles underneath the eye
i like the routine of having an eye cream
then i noticed my entire eye area was drying out
if you are looking to brighten the eye area
still on the hunt
my under eye area was burning
i lost it in my house it's so tiny.
while i was wearing it it took so long to absorb
rather sits on my skin
wipes away when i apply makeup
now my under eyes are back to normal
i will never put it back on my eye lids because it burned them
when i put my makeup on over it
i returned this after i realized it was causing my skin to peek from being even more dry than before i used to
s/arm everywhere on my body
it just never sinks into my skin
it just sits on top and looks greasy.
makes makeup melt off during the day
so every time i use it a bunch of oil comes leaking out before the rest of the product does
i do not use it close to my nose
as next day tiny white bumps appeared under the skin
just testing it on the back of your h
the new container has a front latch
deepened my fine "happy" lines around my eyes
since my family has a history of getting double eyelid surgery due to sagging lids
fine lines i already see cropping up
i need an under eye moisturizer before putting on under eye concealer so that it doesn't settle into my fine lines
clinique suddenly took that off-shelf
brightened my eyes whenever i used it overnight
it cleared up once i stopped using it.
the first time i put it on my eyes watered
my under eye area was irritated to the touch
my makeup settled into the fine lines this product had created from the irritation
as it sometimes left a bit of a stinging/burning sensation around my eyes
on the outside of my eye where i applied it
all three times my eyes end up red
my eyes are burning when i put it too close under
it settled into the creases around my eyes
this has woke me up out of deep sleep every night to rinse my eyes to diminish the burn
the consistency of this just sat uncomfortably on my skin
i lay on my back
i put it to the rest
away because it just stayed to tacky
every night i wear this
it did not breakout my chin
there was definitely a greasy film on my face when i was washing up
i started getting white heads on parts of my face that never ever got white heads
the side of my face that i sleep on feels dried out
i've never once woken up with a "soft
as i was smoothing it on my face after my normal nightly routine
i go to the beach every summer
get my sephora on the go bag
i'll make sure to keep the wei mud tucked with me
could check out this mask before dropping full price for it
i put it on hours before bed
it got all over my bedding while i slept
then causes break outs
big bummer- thumbs down!
already had three pimple form on my face
woke up with the cream still on my face like it didn't absorb at all
as a result my skin breaks out
this product clogged my pores so bad that i couldn't get the breakout to go away for over 2 months
it also seems like it just rubbed off on my pillow
it also broke my face out around my nose
i went back to my other face moisturizer
my irritation completely went away
it made me break out all over my face
this moisturizer made me breakout all over my face
however, it somehow balls up on the skin.
with spring just starting in the northeast it just hasn't been hydrating enough for me
i end up having to slather face oil on top to make up with it
the smell lingers for about an hour for me
takes a lot to cover my face
this isnt every moisterizing for my skin
it was like putting nothing on my face
it just sits on top of my combination skin
after about a week of daily use along with my normal moisturizer
i would still wake up the next day with oily t-zone
it just sinks in
this is says "dark spots fade" ..
my skin still peeling off the next day morning
and also, i think it stuck my pore.
the next day morning i have to use cleanser to wash out this mask
heavy feeling on my face
my face stayed sticky for hours after i applied it
when my pillow case started sticking to my face i couldn't take it
had to return it along with the cleanser.
already my skin is almost back to normal
the lid had a hard time working sometimes
made me break out around the chin
the bottle has spilled out into my bag which leaked through the bag
onto my car seat
started traveling with it in it's own separate plastic bag
it just spilled out into the bag
more than 2drop is nightmare
literally only applied 1 drop
my foundation separated on my face
in the morning under my primer
ive been trying to stray away from using face products with heavy chemical contents in it
i take off my eye makeup prior to using this cleanser
when i do get it in my eyes, it has burned.
cleaned my face well
i like the texture before applying onto my face.
it turns sticky after putting on my face.
i immediately washed it off.
it leaves my skin feeling stick all day long
i put it aside
it was so sticky on my skin that i had to take it back
it made my makeup cake.
it caused a huge breakout area on my chin after using it for a few nights straight
made my face tight
i don´t like the tight feeling of recently having cleansed my face
i tried wearing this in the daytime
need to wash my face mid-day
that there is no make-up left
after washing it off
now it just sits in my shower untouched :
thought i'd switch it up a bit
after going on accutane
will just set it aside
i am getting new break outs just about everyday
it felt like i had to use 5 pumps of product to clean my face
leaves some oil finish on my face
even with makeup removed
i barely have enough foam with one pump to cleanse my face
it removes no eye make up at all
after only a few minutes my fore head started peeling
this seemed to work ok to take my makeup off with two pumps
almost like i have a peeling mask on my face
i put it on my face
it wasn't soaking into my skin so i wiped it off.
you need to put it on at night because the orange colour slightly transfers to your skin
it 'stains' my face when i use it without a lot of time to massage it in
i stopped wearing it altogether feeling strange about the orange cast on my skin
even after three hours i wipe my face with a tissue orange oil comes off
when i wash my face at night
or if i sweat during the day
i don't look orange after putting it on
even after i wiped my h
it made my face
started breaking out and i hate orange smell.
goes away once massaged in
i would stay away from this product
this youth activating oil is just something to watch out for
it felt heavy on my skin
it seemed to sit on my skin
the first time i dispensed it onto my fingers
fine lines under my eyes
i cannot use rest of the bottle for my eyes.
switched back to the other creams now
it's hard to even open your eyes in the morning
interfering with make up
i usually don't break out in the area immediately around my eyes
as it is so oily from the moment i put it on at night to when i wake up in the morning-- even though i use a very tiny amount of product on my eyes
this one made my eyes burn
caused my under eye to puff more
one under eye began puffing
after a 1/2 hour the skin around my eyes is still shiny
if you stop using it the effects wash away immediately
my only clue from the packet was that it said to wash h
i ended up having to wash it off of my face
if you're ever sorted a bucket of coins in your lifetime
every turn of your head, i smell quarters...
i got this from the sun safety kit
this was almost unbearable to me
i washed it off because i don't want to risk waking up orange
i washed it off as soon as i realized
i couldn't put my finger on it
then i washed my makeup off
so...i rushed to the sink and washed it off.
i still wound up needing to wipe off my face regularly
or i looked like i'd been rolling in mud
now i'm freaking out that i'm going to wake up with an orange face
i just put this on my face
i can't get over the foul smell
i put it on before bed
when i woke up my face was bright orange
after putting it on i felt it sitting on my face
the rest is nonsense
it did make my eyes water
s of dollars to get rid of my acne
starting to see some fine lines
i've had to switch back to my other moisturizer
it has an amazing citrus scent that is prfect for in the morning to help my skin wake up
just on the areas of my face that need hydration
it did leave my skin feeling awake
since the texture of it is so slippery it made my foundation move all over the place
then my oils would start to break through
i love the rest of this line
have taken to avoiding putting it around my mouth because it tastes horrible
after applying the product i felt like my make-up would just be sliding off of my face by mid morning
it goes on light
it always ended up stinging my eyes a bit
i assumed i applied the cream too close to my eyes
was hoping it would at least lighten up dark spots
had to stop as i had to keep powdering
so now i use it on my chest
so there is always some product left that gets thrown away
i got bumpy pimple like things on my cheeks where i never break out
it made my face
says i'd wake up looking dewy.
would put it on before bed
i almost dread using it every night because the scent is so off putting
as soon as it gets on the skin it changes into an almost moldy smell
it sits on top only my skin and feels greasy.
i immediately washed it off
also when i wake up i have zits!
when i put this on at night i do not wake up with glowy
i woke up with 3 bumps on the right side of my cheeks
it wouldn't go away
scars are left on my face
i do wake up with soft skin in the morning when i do use this
i washed it off almost immediately.
kept it there overnight
i woke up to the worse breakout on my chin i've had in years
i spent the rest of my vacation with red bumps under my mouth :
then i looked at the fine print
i applied the mask again the next night without applying any of my harsh acne products in order to avoid extra dryness
i woke up the next morning with itty bitty red bumps all over my face
yesterday i got a small red bump that looked like a pimple
then today i woke up with probably 7 red bumps
ended up rinsing off the mask about 20 minutes after putting it on
my skin is clearing up now which i can attri
i just started to get some acne around my lip area
even after a full week of skiing
my chin started to break out!
it never absorbed into my skin
too heavy for me as a day/ night cream.
tends to remain on the surface even in the morning after the application in the evening
i stopped coming to bed with a face that smelled like fish
by the end it was leaving a white veil.
woke up the next day with 4 new pimples.
only use moisturizers it left my face looking like a ghost
the shine is so out of control that i look like i'm sweating
would irritate my eyes within an hour of application
wasn't even putting it on near my eyes.
if i put a phone up to my ear
it sits pretty heavy on the face
caused my foundation to separate on my face
my makeup ended up separating on my face
gave me tiny bumps all over my face.
it took about 2 hours to completely absorb into my skin
after a while, i shine through it.
it breaks me out badly
end up putting my regular face cream over top
in the meantime it did make my skin baby soft
as for evening out skin tone
the lines between my eyes
around my mouth softened up
it dried my skin out pretty bad it's took me almost 2 weeks to get my skin back to normal
the under-eye cream just snapped at the top where it screws into the middle holder
its in a makeup drawer with no pressure
where it screws into the middle holder
until the top of that tube which is half of the packaging- two tubes threaded together- snapped clean off
i immediately switched back to josie maran's argan oil light
my skin calmed down right away
it made my fave extremely oily during the day to the point where my makeup was settling into the lines around my mouth
s to massage onto my face
and all it does is leave a shine on the face.
another product i stopped using to go back to my usual routine
this one made my skin break out in patches of little bumps
i put the mask on
turned into full blown burning
i immediately washed it off
dozens of closed comedones appeared all over my cheeks by the next morning
each time i washed off the mask
did feel my skin brightened up a bit after use
tried it out right away.
with that in mind
pulled the trigger on this mask
yea right before i washed it off.
my skin felt so gross i had to wash it off after a while
this lotion just did not hold up
i usually have to put another moisturizer on top.
it just sort of sits on my skin.
was super happy with it at first about 15% of the way thru the bottle got clogged up
dump it out onto my h
i could feel when i was cleansing that it was a deep clean
this rubbed me the wrong way
i will say it scrubbed away the breakouts i could see forming
risking my skin for
the product inside is ok
i like that my face is clean afterwards
stop making skin care
get on with my routine
my nose still felt oilier than the rest of my face after each wash
the product no longer draws up thru the tube
the resurfacing mask for a couple months my skin got so bad
just waiting to crash off my ledge in my shower
the pump keeps getting stuck
she only needs three pumps to fully clean her face
not stripped too clean
sleep with this scent on my face
the way my skin felt plumped up after using it
could smell it from across the room
the next morning i woke up with under the surface bumps
the smell took about 10-15 to go away
it gave me a headache instantly.
the skin on my neck seemed to respond to this
could feel my skin reacting as i rushed to remove this product
once i cover it up with a night renewal cream
i could not shake it
it was more like dousing my face in stale
puffy eyes are a big warning sign that your body is retaining water
roll the ball with gentle pressure starting from the inside to the outside of the underye
finally i would follow up with a product like ginzing for eyes to fade dark circles
refresh my eyes after working constant night shifts
eye bags at all
you have to finish it up within 6 months
placing that on your bags
i kept it in the fridge
this coming from someone with stage 4 under eye bags
even tried chilling it in the fridge
did break out my chin after a week
this product did clean my face
i would stay away from this one
wondering why i had sparkle on my so call clean face
several times a day i have to pat down my face to hide the shine
this product wears off half-way throughout the day
i decided to get this since i now use the hot pink line from murad
now i've broken out in tiny red bumps
the corner of my eyes started itching
i don't get break outs
in the morning on top of the blemishes i looked sorta dull
little red bumps just keep coming out.
my skin is slowly recovering after i stop using this oil
i kept on getting bumps on my cheeks
made me break out out on my chin
it had my entire face peeling which i know is normal
i apply right after i cleanse my face at night.
once i stopped using the serum all these issues went away
the break-out cleared up as soon as i stopped using this
i can get away with not putting on moisturizer after this
it just sit on the skin
it did feel like it sat on my skin as opposed to absorbing into it
dot it all over my face
after a while it made my face red
after i use up the product
basically remove the black heads
my blackheads have stopped showing up so much
when you add foundation on top
it seems to give off a shiny cast on the my face which didn't go away even after letting the cream sink in for a couple minutes
the thought of using my fingers to grab the product
it just stays on my face without being absorbed.
leaves my face feeling like i hiked across the sahara desert within 30seconds
my face brook out
i wanted my make up not to crease as much under the eyes
i will look for another eye cream.
night like it says on the directions
it does not work for dark circle or lifting at all
not in the habit of spending $60+ on an eye cream
started to give me the "chicken-skin bumps" in the under eye area
one morning i woke up with my eyes so red
now i have peeling under both eyes
still have some left in the pot
my eyes puffed up for the 48 hours following application
instead, it made my under eye skin start peeling.
still crepey with fine lines
on the plus side
primer-like effect before make up
at least lighten the circles by 50% would be fine
it has started to irritate my eyes to the point that my eyes water
fine lines form under my makeup.
it made my eyes burn
put just a dab on my face
i would also just recommend washing your face makeup off first before just so you're not rubbing that into your face
i occasionally break out unless i stay on top of my acne skin care routine
my face feels tight after i use it
left a film on my skin
it also burns if you get it in your eyes
it left my face feeling dull and dirty.
i ended up only using it on dry spots on my cheeks because i felt like i needed to wash it off when kept on too long
put it on b4 bed with my night time routine
my skin began to break out all over my cheeks
yes i patted it in for a long time
i've tried oil cleansing also with no luck.
this stuff made me break out horribly on my chin almost overnight
after a week or so of use my face dries out horribly
once my skin hits that really flaky phase i end up switching back to a lotion
then i find that my face is a little on the dry side around 4 hours in
decided to use this on my body instead by dropping little droplets along my limbs
t ends up leaking oil everywhere
i ended up taking it off with oil absorbing sheets
even at the end of the day now my face is completely shiny
bumps on my right cheek
neck now have bumps
my skin never felt clean while using this product
even for the eyes
it required a lot of scrubbing to get my eye makeup off which just left my skin extremely irritated
i still have to go in with a make up remover wipe after letting this sit in my face for a bit
it won't come close to removing mascara
just leaves bits of the cotton on my face
it did not clean my makeup off at all
wake up looking like a raccoon
it is still on my lashes after using this
it takes off foundation
i got this because i get water everywhere when i wash my face in the sink
it did remove light makeup on my face
i can take off the day's makeup with a few swipes
leave my skin fresh
even after letting micellar-soaked pads rest on my face before wiping
use this every night to clean away impurities
the 5 cotton rounds before they started coming away clean
opted to use it as a cleanser after the gym when i have no makeup on
eye liner that just won't budge after cleansing
i'd rather have a cleanser with water carry away the dirt off my face
with a wipe down with a towel after
the second step makes sure i get the remaining dirt off my face
specially eye make-up and waterproof make-up.
i ended up with a lot of redness after using this
i wasn't a huge fan of this product at first then after i used it a couple times i noticed some mildew like particles floating around in it
left a film on my face.
it loosens up my makeup a bit
i picked this out because it drawn me for its gentle description
it does nothing for my eye make up
take makeup off quickly
i now have had to start buying an eye makeup remover
after removing my makeup
it also takes a bit of effort to wipe off
i can see small closed pimples in the edge of my face
gave me so many breakouts on my nose
has nothing to do with fresh
all fresh masks do
it sat on my face and made me look super shiny.
it just sat on top and felt heavy and sticky.
my skin is still recovering
the lotion was so hard to be absorbed on the face
i started to break out on my cheeks
at the same time it sat on my skin making it seem oily
sits on top of the skin
does keep my face hydrated threw out the day
off for years without realizing that it was the cause of my breakouts
until i somehow wiped it off
uncomfortable to sleep in or apply makeup over
i usually still finish my routine off with a beauty oil to help it out
by the end of the day or when i wake up i'm feeling dry again
my skin got so greasy during the day
it smells although the smell go away after a while
more fine lines under my eyes
it ended up drying me out so much around my eyes.
it burned if a tear shed or to even touch around that area
it helped with my dark circles
cover the dark circle etc
i put it on before i go to bed
i tried putting it on before i apply my makeup
i felt a burning in my eyes after applying the cream
helps a little with my dark circle
i noticed after a full week of using this that my fine lines
stopped hurting i started getting the left over acne scar
my skin was breaking out like crazy
i felt like i was putting perfume on instead of a good facial product
i see fine lines on my cheeks when i take selfie
fake floralbad: did nothing to address the fine lines on my forehead
it caused me to breakout a little on my chin
unfortunately it made by entire forehead breakout
it did not do as claimed in evening out my skin tone or reducing pores
is definietly just part of a routine
on top of the smell
it made me break out a little bit on my chin
am going to try just using the softening concentrate at night instead
made my face burn.
it leaves a film over the face
i did start getting small bumps on my cheek after a week of using this
my face felt greasy throughout the day
at first the concentrate seemed to do its job right by really smoothing the skin
just laid on a surface
once it finally absorbed, my face felt soft.
this would have broken my face out big time.
aside from the fact that this is so strong smelling
it kept me awake at night because that's i could smell
only two areas around my chin that had a bunch of little white heads under the skin
when i received them the liquid the pads are soaked in had completely leaked out so they sent me a free replacement
i stuck with them for a couple weeks in hopes it was just my skin adjusting to a new product
this literally made every clogged pore i've ever had purge
come to the surface finally
it took me month to see my skin actually start clearing up
tried these with the hopes of clearing my troubled skin
made my face itch all night
it made my face peely.
which also goes away
this felt as if my skin was being taken off with a dull knife
it seriously felt like i had just rubbed acid on my face after each use
my face looked essentially the same
fade past dark spots
also use it on my feet- hopefully that helps balance out the disappointment from using it as a facial mask
its still sitting on my shelf
if you sleep on your stomach
be prepared for your pillowcase to just stick to your face after you put this on
before going through the business with the face cloth
then start the face/cloth procedure
then finally they say to rub it off your face in little circles with the cloth
blast it under the hot running water just to get the cloth feeling clean enough to continue with
even after removing it with a dampened towel i could still feel it
i'll sit this one out
oil scrub you could whip up at home
a lot easier than this holding a hot cloth for five seconds five times then circling it off business
it couldn't get rid of all my face make up by only using this product
did remove the makeup-
nose within 6 days of nightly use
it literally takes like 5-10 full minutes of washing
cleansing job are out there
took my makeup off very easily
gave enough slip for a face massage
once in a while i get a blemish
used up a whole bottle
still got dark spots
had to wash it away immediately
make sure you really massage it in for the two minutes before washing it off
i massage it in before my morning shower
just rinse it off there
instead it felt like it left a film on my skin
it reminds me of horse stalls
my face felt dirty
it is absolutely foul and nasty!
i'd give zero stars for this mess
makes me break out
wish the foamy cleanser was back.
works a little better if wiped off with tissue/towel
my skin started to clear up
broken out with acne like i've never experienced before
my skin is only starting to heal
then the night cream
i don't break out from it
the pump gives out as you near the end of the jar
thinking that i could scoop out the last minor bit of the product
noticed my eyes watering like crazy all over my pillow
it can pill up a bit
just looking crepey under my eyes
settles into the creases around my eye
the white grease of this product just stay on my eye area for the whole day
learned quickly that you only need a tiny bit under the eyes
it burned my eyes something fierce when i accidentally got a bit in them
this product balls up like there is no tomorrow
i always ended up using my fingers instead
it definitely settles into fine lines
literally no results, waste of money!
it reminds me of the perfume "escape"
after using the entire bottle i still had dark spots
my skin has once again cleared up
feeling ripped off for the amount of money i spent on such a useless ineffective product
when dreamtone came out i wanted to try it because i have the beginnings of sun spots on my cheeks
it took so long to get rid of it
my entire forehead started breaking out
when i twisted the bottle to pump out my first application
dig in because it took me over an hour to rid of what seemed like a massive air bubble that was stuck inside the bottle
it takes a lot to break out my skin
caused my skin to break-out like crazy
using up the entire bottle
what it did was cause my forehead to break out like crazy
this did not take away my dark spots
my make-up goes on flawless
would come away with several tiny "crumbles"
it was the result of the type of moisturizer i put on afterwards
after trying clinique's dark spot corrector a couple years back
lancome's dark spot corrector made my face break out
i will say that when i woke up the next day i noticed softer smoother skin
nstead of quitting it i apply this on my elbows
i just cut back on the amount i use
i could immediately feel my face tightening up
took to long to rinse well
leave it clean feeling
pick up a tub of the same stuff at the grocery store
now that it's calmed down
going swimming for 3 weeks straight dried my skin out
i think it helped open up my sinuses which helped a lot
there over the summer hoping that my skin would liven up
within 30 minutes of washing this product off i got whiteheads all over my face
i even leave a light layer on overnight once in a while
it perks it up a bit
i wasn't feeling refreshed after taking it off
as an overnight mask
sit on the skin
after washing it off my skin looks the same as it did before
immediately after washing off it does nothing
has a cooling sensation when you put it on
which i do after my nighttime routine
as soon as i put it on my face began to tingle
even when placed in the fridge
left it on overnight once
keep away from your eyes, the packaging says.
i used it for weeks without realizing that it was the cleanser doing that to my skin until i switched back to the cleansing foam
it leaves behind bits of my
it does have the affect of making my skin more moisturized in the morning when i wake up
i'll continue use it only on my chest
my setting powder seemed to have settled in my pores
i've gone through one entire bottle of this product
wasted product=my money out the window.
my face is a pimpley mess.
i will return to my nude oil
the only problem is the packaging is completely falling apart
leaves a ring of oil upon anything on which it rests
end up greasy bc i am using more than two drops each time
either i get air or half a bottle
it was torture trying to get the remains out of the tube
another disappointing thing is the outside of the tube is peeling off sort of like chipping paint
hard to ring out the product
gets onto my face
i am blowing through this tube fast
face feels tight immediately after washing
smell before picking up a reward
i immediately get red
face feels tight immediately after washing
s multiple times to get the smell off
it caused me to break out on my chin
instead it gave me red skin bumps all over my face
a lot in one bottle
even down to chest area
the other areas cleared up
i took the pump apart to see if i could scrape anymore out
24 hours later my skin was peeling off my face
i still have a lot of makeup residue left on my face
the fact that it left my skin kind of tight after cleansing
around my mouth began to become red
can't even wash off the foundation stain on the bottle after several tries
helped cleanse away make up
left it looking dull
i put it on before my foundation
that feeling wears off after about an hour
this entire line makes me break out as well
time on my skin care routine
started to lighten up in color
i woke up shiny
it also give me a a couple of small blemishes all over my face
my skin cleared up
just sits on my face
it looks horrible under makeup — remains sticky so my foundation is just slapped on
i finally decided to take this piece out of my skin care routine
my skin started to calm down
took a lot of massaging to get it to absorb halfway in
it feels like the foundation would slide right off
this might be good to use at night as a sleeping mask
the scent lingers for a while after you apply it
it never goes away even after the moisturizer has absorbed into your skin
i laid off this stuff
will be giving this away.
for my small craws feet to completely disappear
woke up to crusty eyes
my eyes tear for hours after application
my under eye area is so smooth
goes on smooth and seems to sink in.
i'll keep my fingers crossed because product is pricy
it caused me to break out all over my face
recently i've gotten pimples literally all over my face
going back to my old moisturizer
woke up with an oily face if i used it as a night cream
it makes light bounce off the face?
the smell does go away after a short time
f it made a positive difference in my skin then i'd hold my breath
then burned my skin once i applied it to my face
the area all around my mouth
i cap it up every time right after i use the product
did not feel like it smoothed out my under eye area which was a first for an eye cream
i gave it three stars because it washed my face
great at removing make up
left my skin feeling stripped
make it rinse off when you apply water
'd wake up oily every morning
i rubbed the back of my h
this works okay, not earth shattering results.
but the scent throws me right off.
i wear light make up
after i wash my face
now i am left with a face full of whiteheads
all i got was smooth for the immediate 5 minutes after washing my face
i broke out more so now i am trying their clear complexion cleanser along with their charcoal pore pudding
i wanted to change up my cleansing routine!
there was still makeup on the cotton ball
i almost couldn't finish using it on my face
had to wash it off
after using up the breakup cool
i decided to repurchase the boscia cleanser right away
the tsubaki one caught my attention
i will stick with the green boscia for sure
i used this to take off my eye make up this morning
i felt like it did not remove my make-up as well as the cooling break-up make-up cleansing gel
after each time my face has broken out like crazy
took a long time to get my skin back to being moisturized
leaving at least one pimple after use
it removed my makeup
when i tried it at home to remove my make-up
i ended up washing my face again with my trusty drugstore br
i start masaging this onto my face then move to my eyes
actually leaves my face tight
instead it just sits on top of my skin
cause milia around my eyes after 3 nights of use
cheeks were about to break out
please stay away from this product
my face stuck right to the pillow.
this stung my face so badly that i had to wash it off within a minute
it broke me out in areas i don't normally break out in
it left a greasy film even after i washed it off in the morning
it was sticky the entire night.
i rub it in as the directions state
this is literally not an overnight mask
there is nothing remaining on my face in the morning
cream just to use it up
this breaks me out
it's just sitting in my cupboard
easy to forget about before going to bed
just sits on skin.
i woke up and washed it off.
ill skip my nose next time around
i literally saw no change in my skin at after using this product
but it takes forever to sinks in the skin.
it feels like sitting on the surface of my face
woke up with flakes down my cheeks
now i'm at the bottom of the jar
this product together it was giving me chemical burns under my eyes
i will be throwing this product out
please stay away from this cream
i've always had dark circles under my eyes
my eyes were burning after the day of using it my skin has been peeling all around my eye
my entire eye area was on fire.
really scares me away from using other eye creams besides the one i use regularly
i've had dark circles under my eyes for as long as i can remember
i've had dark circles all my life
i gave it one star because it's hard to see my dark circles through the red
i'd prefer to go back to the dark circles
especially in my left eye
the corners under my eyes.
looks fine under makeup
like the makeup was just sitting on my skin
when i started noticing that my dark circles were starting to creep up again
use something else to calm my skin down
after about a month of using it my skin in this area was peeling off
if you touch your face it will roll up
seemed to sink into the skin well
cakes under make up
a minute after applying it when i start applying make up this product creates junk that rubs off
then wipe my face off to get the debris before applying makeup
that my face feels dirty about 15 minutes after an application
it flaked as soon as it started to soak in.
it does dissipate after you put on the cream
then i am back to flaking
i look in the mirror
the way it sinks into my skin quickly without leaving a greasy aftermath
not at all over-powering
was really hoping this could just help with a gentle overturning of skin cells to renew the baby fresh skin we all want
i'll be going back to the nude advanced renewal moisturizer
had to wash the mask off
not a pleasure putting on my face or "peeling" it off
i would wake up with my skin being more red
the peeling it off squicked me out
easy to be peeled off
i ended up washing the remainder of the mask off.
i ended up returning this item for a charcoal mask instead
i still have a good amount in the container sitting in my cabinet
about 10-15 minutes after removing the mask
i almost blacked out from avoiding screaming too loud
pulling out dead skin
it took me more than 30 minutes to peel it all off
the instructions say to peel it off
it took me forever to peel it off
would still give it a three star despite the messiness
i tried this mask before bed.
was still left with some residue
i ended up just washing my face as if this were the cleanser
the mask just sits on my vanity
around my under-eye area
the fact that it peeled right off
i still have all the blackheads i started out with
just washed it off each time.
my face felt clean after
it is so prone to getting stuck in eyebrows
probably because i only temporarily scared my pores into hiding
i will defiantly go back to their original formula " "first aid beauty face cleanser"" once i'm done with this one
then it turned into a grease ball
it was fine for the rest of my body
still needed to use a face wipe after for stubborn makeup
on the side of the bridge of my nose
then put my contacts in
i splash my face with a lot of water
after using this my skin felt tight
meaning it really stripped my skin
my skin has broken out worse than middle school
keeping everything else in my skin care routine the same
i broke out like crazy all over my chin
this is going straight to the garbage!!!
every zit i've ever had left a red mark that faded very slowly
i love the idea of sleeping with a mask on
the fact that the mask balls up
make sure to untwist the cap to finish all of the product up
whatever remaining product has been sitting in my medicine cabinet collecting dust for some time now being that i saw no improvement
try to apply it an hour or so before bed to avoid residue on the pillow
i pumped some out today
unfortunately, this caused my face to break out.
the bumps were in every spot i had put the mask.
i immediately stop using the mask at night
since it's by fresh
i don't see no results with my dark circles or lifting in the eye area
doesn't crumble under make up
doesn't pile up in the little wrinkles around your eyes4
go back to the rose gel cream
i woke up with puffy eyes
he also woke up with puffy eyes
my dark circles and puffiness did not go away.
i woke up with puffy eyes
fine lines or dark circles
have started to see crepe-iness under my eyes over the last year or so
this pulled my under eye skin so tight i looked like a skeleton
made my eyes water like crazy when i put it under my eyes
about 10 minutes after patting this on around my eyes
they started to burn badly
i typically read for a while before falling asleep
sits on top of the skin on my t-zone
the only way to get the stuff out of the bottle is to tap it against your h
applied it after cleansing my face at the end of the day
just ended up washing my face all over again
even after washing my face well that night i woke up with more acne than i've seen on my face in years
had to wash it off.
it picks up next to nothing
luckily i had applied it at night as it was way too visible on me to have worn outside in the daytime
i woke up in the morning with very red cheeks
i look my skin in the mirror
my face was an oily mess for 2 hours before i just had to take it off
i ended up wiping it off
left my skin looking
made my skin break out
my face started stinging the moment i let it sit for a few seconds
woke up in the morning with very clogged pores on my nose
now i wash it off
yikes, used it once and returned it right away.
i like the tingling feeling when you first apply it
it fades after about 10 mins
this kept the flakes at bay
despite my gut feeling
a huge pimple appeared on my chin out of nowhere when it wasn't there before i did the mask
this mask had me feeling greasy immediately
it made my face puff up.
every pore on my face looked irritated
probably on my neck area
however, it balls up like crazy.
won't absorb, balls up, rolls of face.
it constantly is balling up
the texture is nice when you first put it on your fingers tip
once it's on the face for 5 minutes
balled up on contact w my h
yes, i warmed the product up in my hands.
unfortunately after 5 mins of having this cream on it starts to ball up
i used a lot of eye cream on my eye area
it leaves the eye area completely white if you have to reapply
i would have to scrub it off with a cleanser at the end of a day at the beach to get it off
hard to remove, and settles into fine lines.
going to use it on my nose
other face parts that not close to my eyes
over my eye day cream
this product stung my eyes
my face stung when i put my cream on afterward
it made my eyes sting
while it will take off eye makeup
hold it on your eye for about 20 seconds
they are starting to appear on my cheeks as well
for face makeup alone
i follow up with a cleanser
my face is fine
after using this i still had to go in with a make-up remover wipe
i still had a lot of makeup left after rinsing
even if the pump is in the locked position
its my ride or die face wash
ok so this product removed swatches on my h
when i tried to remove my eye makeup at home
removed all of my makeup
i kept hoping it was skin purging
make sure you keep your eyes closed while massaging into the lid
don't open them until after you've rinsed
every time i use it my vision is blurry for about an hour
ruined a pair of contacts this way.
this is okay at removing makeup
3 times a charm, trying bobbi brown next.
it stings a lot and will temporarily blind you.
i would only recommend using this to take off makeup around your eyes
face makeup in a single step
when i try to take eye makeup off it leaves a white hazy film in my eyes that temporarily blinds me
get into my eyes
i normally use makeup wipes to break up my eye makeup
take away those extra steps
pros: breaks long wear foundation like a dream
after going in with numerous pumps i found a black ring around both eyes still lingered
if i take my eye makeup off with contacts in it makes them blurry for 30 mins
cleanse the face however it bothers my eyes after i use it
wake up with at least 3 new zits
this was recommended to keep foundation from sinking into those lines
i tried this product because i saw jaclyn hill mention in a few of her videos saying that it helps with lines in the skin to help makeup from creasing
smash box too faced benefit
i still managed to see fine lines on my face
made the makeup slide around
only have a couple fine lines under my eyes
this product did nothing for filling in my pores or even my tiny fine lines under my eyes
my makeup went over this very smoothly
i tried it alone, under my makeup and i top.
although i do notice the "blur" effect whenever i take photos
wears off throughout my workday
i used the whole wallet draining bottle
the foundation stayed on the brush
all the foundation comes right off
would clean up their act
my face has broken out like crazy from this
jury's still out on this one girls.
and make my face look shiny after 6 or so hours.
filled in the lines
it gave my face a good canvas to work on.
1-minute blur is not the answer
it does go away
with the summer coming my skin can get greasy
another thing i've noticed is that it flakes off if i touch my face after i apply it
i broke out all over with huge whiteheads
as soon as i eliminated this product from my routine they went away
it also stung when i put it on my face.
gave me bumpy welts all over the rest of my face for a week
i applied in the morning after washing my face
went on smoothly without sitting on my skin for too long
my face feels tight after applying
made my face all red
the fact that it "rolls"
no results it just sits in my drawer
cucumber gel mask on for a good hour before the redness started coming down
i even tried using the product just on my chin
this product is just money down the drain.
burned my eyes just like the rest of them
on the first day of use it barely kept my face moisturized 'til noon
have to shake out the concentrate
there is about 1/4" of product left on the bottom
tone or fine lines
i am constantly on the go
i didn't even bother to give it away- i sent it straight to the garbage bin
the only eye cream that i toss to trash after a couple of uses so far
although the product did help brghten the bags under my eyes
it remained with a residue under my eyes all day long
it did a good job covering a large scar under my eye
even though it creases up a bit
completely filled up the tube's cap
i should be able to put the tube in my makeup bag without it exploding everywhere
wakes me up a bit.
the sephora person put this under my eyes before concealer
it just squeezes out
it went right in my creases
had to keep touching up with eye cream
i fly all the time
this is a disaster in my makeup bag
didn't work for my very pale blue circles or minimize my fine lines under the eyes
s or going to the gym
at first it makes it look like it hides the dark circles
just use my ring finger
after trying on the light shade
i still love bareminerals "stroke of light" for under eyes
i got through only half the container before it won't stick to my skin
i sadly had to throw it away.
i put it on my face
instead of staying on my face it sticks to my fingers when applying it
i see little to no difference on my skin after washing it off
it would just chunk up and stick to my fingers.
instead of transforming back into bruce banner after washing it off
or after applying a hot towel over your face to open up your pores for maximum effect
i'll hulk it out for 15-20 minutes
then use a washcloth to get everything off
follow with the rest of my nightly face routine
honestly i'm grabbing for my other masks because of it
i'll give it another whirl
like putting water on your face
have had to pry off the top of the container to spoon out the product
step it up on your packaging, ren!
it is still sitting in my cabinet unused
there was still makeup left on my face
it does help with taking off makeup
leaves my face clean
it gave me nasty pimples after using it twice
there is no way that the cloth would cover an entire face
leave it on all night
you wash it off the next morning
t's easy to sleep with it on
with make up or without make up
after washing it off
i try the fresh rose mask
put it on the fridge
all im going eyes closed with fresh rose mask
i could barely wait the full 10 minutes before getting this off of my face
i leave it on about 15 minutes before rinsing off
i discover a few red bumps come out afterwards
i am still breaking out as a result of this mask
whole middle of my face is an angry red
some part of my skin get red
it did leave a lot of redness on my nose for an hour
my skin is getting back to normal
my skin is all red after putting it on for 2 mins
rinse it off immediately and my face is all red.
i clean my face
all area are pinky and fell not normal.
decided to give this a whirl
my skin has started peeling off in the t-zone
my face feels clean after
instead it only dried out my face more
whatever the day has thrown at me
if you accidentally get it in eyes is vicious
on the plus side the product lasts forever
perhaps the take away is that if you have fairly low maintenance skin needs stay away from ptr
i ended up using this as $38 body wash.
give it another shake during the summer when my skin is oilier
my skin is already clearing up
my face felt uncomfortably tight
almost gritty for the rest of the day
takes all the yuckies off my face
once i noticed those i had the same thing on the corners of my mouth
i would have kept this product though if it was for the fake perfume scent in it
then all of a sudden it starts to eat your skin
where i place the makeup to put on my face turned red
anywhere it touched my face
i am crossing my fingers
i tried to mix it up
the more i build it up the more i smell like a walking bottle foundation
the last thing is the cap somehow breaks down over time
however, the screw top basically leaks.
then realized the extra oil that it made me very oily
this did nothing in regards to covering it up
am careful to wear it when i spend time outside
it left my skin with a hint of color that by the end of the day had turned the color of clay
put it on my face
feels like putting toothpaste on your face
the product first tingled then burned the heck out of my face
red face all day
it says "wake up call
it will wake you up
so will having someone dump a bucket of ice water on you
then it kept tingling.
i washed it off twice and still burned.
left my face bright red after only minutes
when i put it on my neck it got red
which explains the burning sensation when you put it on
turned my face completely red after 10 minutes -- i look like i have massive sun burn in the areas where i applied it
i washed my face twice to get it off
a few drops patted in is all you need
pills up under makeup or if you use any kind of rubbing motion
i usually wake up with a few dry patches depending on how much effort i place into my routine at night
i returned this along with the moisturizer.
pray i won't wake up with a new pimple
the sample felt so nice when i smoothed it over my face before bedtime
my skin drank it up so fast i had to be sure to quickly apply a night cream over it
put some on my neck
i noticed that this cream opens up the pores
it will sit on top of your skin for ages
the area around my eyes where i put the cream became super red
it did not clear up the skin around my eyes like it claims
as the day passes
might be a bit stickyside effects: i got a white bump by my eye
put it on i ended up with a massive headache from the overly strong scent
i ended up washing it off in the middle of the night
don't wear make-up
i would stay away from this gel unless you want the skin under your eyes to shine big time
after the trip this product melted crazy
light lines under my eyes
by the end of the day i'm constantly cleaning my undereye as all my makeup has managed to slide down from the eye gel
have been using forever the too faced eye shadow primer
the next morning my eyes literally looked like i had shoved my face in salt
put it too close to my lash line
hardly notice any difference aside fro my nose being smooth
the dark spot fix is a huge waste of a lot of money
i applied it to just one patch of sun damage twice a day
until the bottle was empty
i applied it just to the dark spots
honestly removed like 4 black heads
half of the strip stayed on my face after i tried peeling it off
when left your face the strip gets hard like paper mache
it definitely pulled out way more blackheads
the soothing strip was nice after i took the pore strip off
after taking the strip off i saw no blackheads removed on the strip
pulled the skin right off my nose
was hoping this would degunk my nose after being away in the sun
the pores on my nose were just as clogged after using this product as before
i think it temporarily tightened my nose pores
it ripped off skin on the side of my nose
also, it hurt to peel off!
i liked the follow up wet strip to soothe
when i woke up some blackheads were worse
the first strip you apply to a wet face
the strip took skin off my nose.
the dry strip did not pull out one black head
got it to stick to my nose
some of it still stuck to my skin
what i did really like was the wet strip you put on directly after you remove the dry strip
it pulled some extra dirt out of my pores
it was a little disturbing to see all the little specks on the patch when you pull it off
i tried the second patch on my chin instead of my nose
it hurt less taking it off
immediately when you place the day cream underneath the eye it brightens it up almost immediately
the daytime creme burned my eyes after only one use
it was so bad that i had to wipe it off almost immediately i suspect the spf was way too harsh for my sensitive eye area
i considered tossing the night cream in the trash after trying the day cream
my fine lines were nowhere to be found!
rritated that everything else i put on burned
the day really brightens up my eyes
at night when washing my face
aside from the stinging
it burned my eyes for about 15 minutes
the eye burning happened again once the water hit my face
it felt fine on my face as it dried.
after washing it off
my face is still trying to recover from this mask
definitely check out the smell in store before picking this up
putting my skin through this scrutiny was a mistake
when i applied water after it dried like instructed it was so awkward to wash off
was expecting it to turn into an oil cleanser
also it left my skin very red after.
i didn't notice any changes in my skin after i washed off the mask
it did make my face tight
it just dried up on my face
i kept it on for 10 mins
i got 3 massive pimples on my face after using this
a lot of my blackheads have gone away
still give this a thumbs up
this mask made me break out!!
the moment i put the product on my skin it started instantly burning
i prefer the white mask out of the whole line.
mostly just black head issues
had to immediately wash off
taking care of my skin
the instructions say to lightly tap the bottom of the bottle if the product gets stuck
the top of the dispenser would keep popping off
getting stuck in the down position
the directions say to bang on the counter when the product won't come out
red spots across my whole face
after a couple weeks i started breaking out on my chin
dried my face out just like the conducting gel
my fine lines disappeared right away.
within a few minutes my skin broke out everywhere in small pimples all over my face
i washed the product off immediately
i accidentally left it open one night to find it dry the next morning
even then i wasn't blown away by the results by any means
however when used overnight i notice less puff in the mornings
let alone eye makeup
literally pills off once it dries
the sticky feeling is still there causing the skin under my eyes to stick together
within an hour an especially in the morning the skin around your eyes are sticking together in spots
i actually see more fine lines in the morning from the gel hold the skin together in the same position
although sometimes i still wake up with very puffy eyes
to the point where my little fine lines stick together
i found it sticky that when i would wake up i would literally have to move my skin
it also felt as though i was a crafty preschooler that had just spread good old elmers glue all over my delicate eye area
it feels awkward blinking for the rest of the night even when the smallest possible amount of product is used
my fine lines under my eyes would be stuck together all night
nstead of helping my under eyes
it sits under your eyes
my eyes kept sticking to my pillowcase despite my applying it a good half hour before i went to bed
i saw no lifting or firming in my eye area while using this
the face is a mess
my hair and pillow get stuck to it all night.
the area around my eyes only started to brighten when i used this product in combo with something else
the eye cream like of ball up
i put this on before bed
the skin around my eyes stung when i was putting it on
as far as getting rid of my puffy eyes
this morning i've had to scrub at my under eyes to get it off
i am throwing this straight in the trash.
i swear i wake up with bigger bags under my eyes
was peeling the next day
i still use until i find another eye cream to fix my fine lines
it just left a film on my under eye area that didn't absorb well
so later my concealer would react with it
when i would wake up, it was still sticky.
use whatever i pick up for both my eyes
even after waking up in the morning
i could feel my eyelids are sticking together
why wear it to bed when it gives an instant lift?
within seconds of applying i could see my face beginning to turn bright red
immediately washed it off
this face wash was just ok
still left a lot of makeup residue after using it
my skin was stripped after usage
went back to get a dior gentle cleansing milk suggested by an employee
this product made my face burn
slide all over the place with this cream
it made my eyes water
the smell almost wants to make my eyes water
it took around 30 minutes for me for it to fully absorbed into my skin
i could put up with the smell
i wish i had rubbed this between my fingers before applying
after i put this on my face
it was so thick i went pack to the packaging to make sure it wasn't foot cream
it turns my face into a grease ball with ten minutes
if it dissipated right away that would be okay
it stays all night
after two uses my face was itching
i will be switching back to the precious line
even though i didn't apply it right near my eye some of it crept in
neck have broken out in little hard bumps
it did help brighten up my dark circles
brown spots where i've not had any
or fine lines on my face after 2 months of daily use
on the plus side
eye cream in the set
one or two pumps all over my face
back to philosophy for me.
se how your skin reacts on the next two days
i still had raccoon eye from my eye make up.
my eyes look no different at all
my eyes would be red
puffy the next morning
hanging onto the bottle for refills when needed from my regular size wash will likely make up for it
worth keeping up with my beauty routine
i just use it at night before i sleep now.
it was just to strong of an odor for me to stick with it
it looked like i skipped my eye cream regimen altogether
wait a while then add face primer
the primer crumbles when i put it close to my eyes where this product was
which really did take years off by getting rid of my eye wrinkles
makes my eyes water-- which is troublesome in the morning when i'm trying to put on make up
i went back to the regular korres oak eye cream
it also smoothed the fine lines under my eyes.
it feels like my face skin is pulled up
it balls up something fierce under makeup
the jury is still out on whether it has really helped the sag at the sides of my mouth
when i cut the tube open
still on the fence on this one.
the scent lingered on my fingers afterward
the product made my face sting a little in less then a minute
beside taking off all the moisture that was in my skin
pass on this and save your money.
when i was washing it off
i kept them in a ziploc bag in the dark.
go out in the sun
i did a patch test on my arm
had to wash my face
was hoping for something to perk up my winter skin
just like the rest of ren's products
i even had to wash my towels right away as they held onto the stink
i immediately washed it off
it was still red
woke up the next day with red splotches on my previously clear face
roll it all off before you begin
my skin felt fine throughout the day
looked in the mirror
then it stays on its surface
still trying to make up my mind
it didn't calm down my skin at all.
at the same time sting my eyes
it caused my face to break out in little red bumps
the bumps have since cleared up
rub it into my skin instead
i also prefer masks that leave you feeling fresh
i often find myself re-washing my face with a second cleanser
i also don't wear makeup so the first part of rubbing on the face seemed redundant
i ended up using wipes to finish the job.
it made my skin break out
to get through my wash
i got this in the cleansing set
it takes off my makeup
it does a good job of taking off my makeup without leaving a residue or breaking me out
starts out as a gel then turns into a oil
then a cream when you add water
it's only on my face for a minute or so
then the add water
it first comes onto your h
then as you put it onto your face it turns into an oil
then once you add water it turns to a cleansing foam
make up on wash cloth after using.
i always go over my face twice with the cleanser
i end up with a lot of foundation
burn só badly my eyes
i cant use to remove my eyes make up
you need to remove it first with a cleanse wipe
then wash your face with it
i got this in the sephora great cleanse set.
had to follow up with a better cleanser
it still left a film after scaling back
it does the trick to remove make up
i much prefer the boscia make up break up oil.
i need to use a make-up remover pad beforehand.
all make up was on pad
there is always a little dirt that is pulled off even if i cleaned religiously the night before
i still find that i have left over mascara
leave the dirt there?
it balls up and won't spread.
what looks to be the first sign of crow's feet
unlike when i first started with the complete eye renewal balm
i used the entire container waiting to see any difference underneath my eyes
the few times i've gotten it into my waterline i've never felt any stinging
after looking in the mirror
i noticed that the skin around my eyes was pulled so tight i looked like i was perpetually squinting
so, does this tighten the skin around the eyes?
it made the whole area around my eye red
it still made my eyes burn
so even the area under/around my eyes can develop tiny bumps with the wrong eye cream
went back to using the regular algenist renewal eye balm
made the skin below my under eyes breakout.
using this left my eyes with a burning feeling.
i put moisturizer on afterwards at night
i love that this pair leaves my face less red
s get oily after using it the jar becomes hard to hold onto to get the lid back on
this balm is great for removing most of your make up
it can remove eye make up
can easily be wiped away with the remaining rubbed into your skin
when i pick up the heavy glass jar to put it back
the entire top of the jar shattered leaving glass shards in the cleanser
i followed the directions all the way through
it gets 2 stars instead of 1
if you use it on its own it leaves an oil/gel like film on the face
you're better off with a face wash from this company
feels like it leaves a film behind
although at firt is seemed like my makeup was melting away when i went over my face with a cleansing pad to test it i still had a lot of makeup on
i prefer to wash my face in the shower after letting the steam open up my pores
i still had to use my normal face wash after.
there is still a lot of makeup left on the cotton pad
leaves behind a film of oil that is difficult to wash off
then use a regular cleanser to wash your face?
that in the end all this does is just break up the make up in preparation for a cleanser
then when you apply water to turn it into a "milk"
if you need to remove your daily make-up
eye makeup was smoothed away quickly
i ended up using nearly hot water to make my face feel closer to normal
i finally just had to give up after my breakouts got to the point where i am embarrassed to be seen without makeup until my skin heals
at least 25% of my face is now covered in acne
my skin is finally starting to heal
made my skin break out
i got make-up all over my towel
while this cleanser took off most of my makeup
water gets in it
just get wasted between your fingers before you even apply it to your face
left my face feeling like it needed to be washed again
my face was straight up greasy
it almost left a film that i couldn't wash off.
have to wash my face twice with my daily cleanser
i give it two stars instead of one because it did work well at removing makeup
it unfortunately left me with breakouts on both of my cheeks
and it removed all makeup.
but it caused my skin to break out
it takes off makeup
what i had loved up to today was it rinsed off fairly clean
f i'm going to double cleanse the first step needs to remove my makeup
i would stay away
so that it rubbed off when i ran my finger over it
you go out into the sun
after using the whole jar
then i started noticing drying under my eyes
it burned the area around my eyes
every morning and sometimes at night.
def couldn't wear under make up.
i went in needed a mask or creme because heat
the little bit she said use didn't cover face let along neck
just now starting to come into my own skin routine that makes me all glowy in the mornings
end up throw it away because those really bad invisible bumps it gave me
it broke me out the next morning with little bumps everywhere
'd do my normal night time skin care routine
then put it all over my face
it remains sticky clear into the next morning after applying
everyone is getting into the overnight mask game
i only like the fresh sensation at the beginning
i put this on after washing my face
i suddenly got more breakouts
that covers all of my face
maybe it brighten up my face
yet every single moisturizer i have tried to use over top of it has caused it to ball up
doesnt work for my dark circles
yes have a few lines in the lower bag area
2 with make up 1 with out
it thins out very quickly i had to keep reapplying the product to my clarisonic to finish my routine
finally i just used my hands !
it calmed my redness that was left after removing my make up
i put it on my face
due to it burning my face so bad
my face felt clean after using it
use it in my morning shower when i don't have eye makeup on
my skin felt tight after using it
it didnt calm anything at all
i wiped them both off
right after application my face felt tight like like the tightness you feel after you wash your face
the next morning i woke up with 2 huge blemishes
i woke up with more blemishes
to add to the disappointment i have completely broken out
i rarely give up on a product
i put it on under my make up
then it began pilling on my skin if i even slightly touched my face
putting on even the tiniest bit of makeup was a nightmare
it makes everything after it balled up
it balled up badly
reapply my night cream again
after cutting it out
i tried it under makeup
my skin instantly got red
i felt stinging all over
i put it under my makeup for an " instant beauty shot"
firming in my eye area since that's the only place i need it
my skin stays shiny after i put it on
it feels silky going on my face but broke me out.
white heads were all gone
i placed the saturated cotton ball on my eye lid left it for a few seconds before i began to wipe off the mascara
with this product i find myself tugging at my eyes
the last thing you want to do is tug near your eyes which in the long-run causes wrinkles
the rest of my face makeup completely wiped off — foundation
substitute for face wash in the morning
packed the product in my makeup bag
i made sure the bottle was closed tightly
secure in the bag
it really breaks down the oil on my skin.
clean up leftover makeup on my face
how anyone gets their face clean just using this product
leaves a film on my face
then stung my eyes like crazy when i tried to get the black mascara circles off my face
it broke me out the next day after use so badly that my entire face was covered in zits
on the plus side
then sometimes still using another product to remove the residue left in
it also burns if you get it in your eyes
accidentally open my mouth or lick my lips for twenty minutes after or i'd get a bad taste in my mouth from the micro water on my face
it took so many cotton rounds to remove everything from my skin that i may as well have used a makeup remover wipe
i ended up rinsing my face to remove the residue left behind
it made my eyes burn
my face is covered in bumps
so seeing my skin literally covered is a little terrifying
by the last use my skin had completely broken out with texture all over my cheeks
under my eyes right up to my lower lash line
have made sure to wash my face morning
it did firm up my cheeks
however it also made me break out on my chin
this night cream every other night
it make my skin break out
after using it one night i woke with little bumps all over my cheeks
to leaving a film on my face all night?
for me, this just sits on my skin overnight.
let's start off with i love the fresh black tea line
it sat on top of my skin without soaking in the entire night
i would woke up every morning withe the pores super big
when i wash my face in the morning it is very slick when the water hits it
to be expected with a super thick cream on your face all night though
will keep up as a nightly regime
eventually balls off my face
it took me 5 solid minutes to clean it off my face
hard to keep my hair out of it
it was hard to wash off
takes forever to sink in
you cannot just jump right into bed
it'd have to look like the plastic-surgeon fairy came during the night in order for me to buy it
to the point where i didn't want to lay my face on my pillow at night
this product clogged almost every pore on my face
we literally wash our face with cristco.
skin felt tighter next morning
still on the hunt to find the perfect night cream
i need an overnight mask"
kept getting stuck to my freshly washed pillows
i got red bumps all over my face
still trying to get rid of the bumps :
the left side of my body got really numb for about two hours
when i wake up
this was the only change i made to my skin care routine
got bad bumps all over his face the next morning
i switched back to my regular night cream for a bit to find out whether it was the mask or the winter season that was making my skin drier
it was fine for my face
after a day tiny red bumps started appearing all over my skin
was using it on my smile lines
it was at least gentle on my skin
expression lines after i put it on
i only have a few fine lines on my forehead in my mid-40's
it balls up horrible under makeup of all kinds
this product balls up when you put makeup over it
i used this around my eyes at night before bed
tried it again 3 months after getting botox when the effects started fading
on the plus side
the problem with this is its in a dark bottle
there is a piece inside the bottle that pushes the product out
happen to rub under my eyes afterward
it was just an unnecessary extra step in my skin care
does give my eye area a little lift temporarily
i think i see a tiny bit of temporary fine wrinkle smoothing after i put it on
as there is a white piece inside taking up the other 1/2
i feel so ripped off - $89.00 - what a waste!!
when you wash it off
it did temporarily improve the look of fine lines
until i washed my face
this face wash broke me out horribly
my face broke out everywhere after using this
my skin still won't clear up
the pump is always getting clogged
it was okay as far as washing off makeup
it says right on the bottle that it should take away oil
i just use cleansers to keep my face blemish free
it clears my acne up really fast
in order to get a good foam i had to leave my h
s under the running water while rubbing them together
then half of the product got washed down the drain
after the second use i had red dry patches of different sizes all over my face
also all of these little bumps which close up are white heads
after using this product it made me breakout on my cheeks
i got the travel-size version of this to keep in my gym bag
feels clean after using this
after a few uses of the product the pump will get stuck after pushing it down so that in order to pump product out you have to physically pull the pump back up then push down
that is a turn off
i keep it in the shower
the pump on this thing breaks every time
i keep getting new ones and i've just given up.
so, this sits, sadly, in my shower...unused.
it would remove all my left over face make up while cleansing
falling in love with the glamglow masks
i eventually developed really bad patches of breakouts directly in the middle of both sides of my cheeks
more so just swishing some product on my face with water
my skin began to clear up
you have to pull up the pump each time to get the product out
face wash in one
after about the 2nd 3rd time my skin broke out very bad on the bottom half with very small pimples all over my chin
my face feels clean after
felt that it helped keep my skin in check
had to pull it up
was so fed up that i tossed it
hard to rinse off also.
i stuck by this product for 3 weeks through constant breakouts every single day thinking i was 'purging'
forcing myself through the rest of the bottle with each frustrating pump
no matter how many times i splashed my skin with this it just sat there on my face
another cleanser to get it all off
which i then had to scrub off with a towel or another cleanser
as a face make up remover, it was disappointing.
leaving it looking red
instead made me greasy
i slowly started to break out
it will kind of ball up if i'm using a makeup brush
i quickly switched back to hope in a jar
i am still trying to clear up the damage it has left behind
stuck with my usual moisturizer
makes you break out after use
i don't want to be walking around with flakes still left in my hair
just about to the bottom of my jar.
the next morning i put this on under my benefit porefessional along with face makeup
plus it made me break out.
after awhile it started peeling off my face
for an entire month i felt so ugly
picked up a different face cream
it has literally burned the skin around my eyes
the product was terrible for my skin to the point that it dried out the skin surrounding my eyes so badly that it has cracked
every day for hydration around my eyes
not even lightening of the dark circles i get after long nights
could put this near my eyes
woke up wondering why my lips felt so moisturized
the area under my eyes we're swollen
hurts my eyes & the smell is off.
am hoping my skin clears up fast
after cleansing at night
my eye makeup barely came off
still have makeup residue on my face
this product is basically straight oil.
so before i moisturized i put more on to take my makeup off
if i try a face wash
put it back in the packaging to take it back
still got the breakouts
there was so much make up left after two washes with this
after using it for around a week i noticed i started to get milia bumps all on my forehead
i would get little bumps all over my chin
i put it on as an overnight moisturizer
when i woke up the next morning i had little red pimples everywhere
all over my face that were impossible to get rid of
made sure to double cleanse every night
to my surprise i woke up with 5 new zits :
it just sits there.
wake up then next morning it's still sitting on my face
my skin is normally quite clear aside from a few breakouts around my time of the month
after just one night almost all of the bumps have hit the road
then i put this on to seal it all in
just one drop per section of my face
they are meant to be used to seal in all the good stuff you have just put on your face before you go to bed at night
this just never soaked in
was afraid to put my face on my pillow to stain it
i tried to stick it out
i wake up everyday w a new pimple
each time i used this i woke up super oily
my chin broke out worse than it ever has before
the only upside is that my skin felt smoother in the morning after applying it before bedtime
back to the store it goes.
it felt like i was rubbing water on my face
then in the 3rd week i started getting dry patches on my chin
i hated the feeling of it on my face as i went to sleep
maybe i just rubbed all the stickyness off on my pillow
my skin is quickly clearing up again
it cleared up right away
stripped after using that i couldn't wait to put moisturizer on
i ended up needing to use a mask to rehydrate
got this in de let's b clear set
tight feeling i always immediately got after rinsing it off
i used the rest on my body to use it up.
skin felt filmy the next mornings after applying the usual face oil
the bar to help calm my skin down
i ended up getting a tiny cut from it that i didn't notice until i put on toner
the rest of my skin i have no problems with.
i just add a bit of water on the bar
then wash my face
then i tried it on the rest of my body
like the bottom of my feet
i woke up today to find three blemishes under my eye area
not on eye area
the oil made me break out so bad the next day around the cheek area
i don't break out at all
maybe i'm out of the loop
if i drop on my finger tips it just runs all over the place
the next morning woke up with a huge cluster of whiteheads on my cheek
my skin is still recovering from it
big point to take away
will stain face towels you take it off with indefinitely
only in the area between my nose
i started to get tiny bumps all over my face
tossed it out straight to the trash.
by the 2nd morning i had tiny white bumps all over my highlight area below my undereye area
the water will stay in the cap
left a rough white film on my face that took days to peel
now my face is back to normal.
it left my face with a greasy film all over it.
i still had to go in with a cleansing oil
it burns your eyes if you get it inside
i usually had to wash my face twice with this stuff to get 90% clean
i rotate between not wearing make up
so when i was washing my face with this after not wearing my powder
when i used my fab pads after that there was still discoloration on them
i guess my skin just holds onto make up
follow-up makeup remover to clean everything off
i tried the next day to wash my face with it
after you get it off
will just stick to my boscia green cleansing oil.
it took me a few tries before i realized i was supposed to wipe off the cleanser from my face instead of washing it off
it stung the heck out of my eyes
overtime the skin under my eyes have become very soft
i went to buy this eye cream way too fast
the little iron head caught my eye
my under eyes could only look semi okay due to nars concealor covering it up
it made my eye area look grey
which made my eyes water
i'll continue to use it for de-puffing after sleepless nights of writing papers until i find an all-in-one cream that i like better
have to almost bust the cap to take it off each
has zero coverage of dark circles under my eyes
looks like i'm stuck with it
or for tired morning eyes
i wouldn't put this around my eye.
every time i put it on, my eyes start itching.
i'd like to see how this item works after a long sleepless night
i got my eyebrows done at the benefit brow bar in sephora
as soon as i left the store it started to make my eyes water
it was starting to irritate my eyes
it only started flaking off when i'd apply this eye cream under it
the product actually flakes a but after a while.
just another product promising to get rid of bags under eyes
it burned when i put it on
made my under eye makeup crease throughout the day
it felt like i'd taken a layer off
it got my face clean but that's about it.
like a stretched out snare drum
it left a gross film on my face
i also love how clean
just a dab is all i need for my entire face.
it would make the products roll up
it just made everything sit on top instead of helping it sink in
while also breaking me out
various makeup products to ball up on my skin
after it soaks in it left me needing extra lotion
adding this product to my nightly routine was the only difference in my skin care regimen that i had made
my skin started to clear up
cake in some areas around my nose
always put my night cream over
straight after the shower
i love the pink rose stem cell one though it is amazing to wear over night
it cleared up in a day.
beware of this mask of bringing up impurities to the surface- you might break out
got this in the holiday black and gold kit.
i would give it away
woke up with a million white heads.
then washing my face with a clarisonic to remove
put this mask all over my face except for my nose where i apply the origins charcoal mask
smooth after sleeping in it
it sits under my sink
on the plus side
it won't stop burning
blackheads i wanted cleared up
i will finish up the bottle
it burned as soon as it touched my skin.
i still covered my whole face
help put some moisture back
after the 10 mins was up i washed it off as directed only to reveal what looked like a bad sunburn
this barely made me tingle
i got this as part of the "just mask it" 3-pack.
my sink looks like an orc was just slaughtered in it
started to feel some warmth almost like my face was getting close to a campfire around my cheeks
i washed off the mask after 10 minutes
when i removed the mask
i felt my face getting hotter then a burning sensation
i went to remove the mask to find that it burned my skin
when it came time to rinse it off
in order get the residue all off
the next day i woke up to pimple on my cheeks where i never break out
it left my face red
it does create the right amount of foam for entire face to be cleaned
just putting it on your h
i can literally feel it pulling my skin when i done washing my face
at first it just dried out my skin
washed my face again
a layer of my face came off
now i'm stuck with it
left my face feeling clean
am starting to get fine lines
i gave this product a 3/5 stars because it did clear up my acne
going back to ph advantage cleanser.
i've started using it as an upper body wash
it isn't blowing me away
on the plus side
cleared my skin up like you wouldn't believe
adding this cleanser into my routine i saw no difference in my fine lines
when i woke up my skin was bright red
i put it on my face
woke up the next morning with my face bright pink
at first i wanted to chalk it up to other things
the skin around my nose actually cracked open
broke out all over my chin and neck.
so you should pop them between your fingers first
this eye cream burns like crazy for at least 5 mins post-application
my make-up seems to on smoother
for dark circles under eyes
leaves white film under my eyes when i put it
tried different eye cream
tried it on clean skin without any other product
i put it on under my under eye cover up
it only made my under eye area red
i've tried many eye creams that claim to get ride of under eye circles
has messy little beads that must be smashed before they go under your eye
this product did nothing for the dark circles under my eyes
this product is stinging when i put it on
puffiness after having 2 kids starting at the age 37
good luck roll tide
i felt stinging on the skin around my eyes
definitely tightens the skin around my eyes
sometimes i notice that one is still on my face after i've left the house
my face is still horribly broken out
had to stick my finger in there to get some out
it left my face feeling clean.
my face is finally back to its original soft
a lot of bumps started to apear on my skin
just throwing it i the bin
the scent is so strong it sticks to your skin for hours after having used it
on the 3rd time it really made my skin burn
from now on i'm sticking to amorepacific/more gentle br
the cap keeps slipping off, so be careful!
it leaves a residue on my skin that i have to cleanse my face with another soap just to get it off
i felt that it was hard to rinse off immediately.
this looks just like the treatment mask when it comes out of the bottle
found the cleanser to have little chunks in it when i applied to my face
then add water to foam it up
didn't have to open the container
it takes off my make up well but that's it
kept making me break out
i woke up the next morning to little bumps all over my chin
it almost felt like scales.
caused me to break out in places i've never broken out
the problem came in the form of whiteheads that popped up around my eyes
fast forward to 2 days after
along with the mask
slightly down my neck
it hasn't gone away
used it right away
as i started to wash the product off my face
i woke up one day with deep wrinkles under my eyes
i felt that this eye cream was a bit on the heavy side
i'd wake up feeling quite greasy on my face.
i think some of the product spreads to the cheek area while sleeping
at first, this eye cream goes on smoothly.
after about an hour or two it starts to pill into little balls all on its own
the product mostly just sits on top of the skin until it dries
it sits on top of my under-eye area
when i put it around the eye area
it will look like i have almost toothpaste on my face
it does ball up
get a new eye cream
this made me break out with little bumps under my eye
when i rub it or put makeup under my eye
it has done nothing for my dark circles or fine lines
what's worth is that the next morning my eyes were red
i can just peel off the cream from under my eyes
it just sits on my skin.
made putting concealer on a nightmare.
water at night when i lay down after i have applied it
it tingles when i put it on
it felt nice when i put it under my eyes momentarily
then it dried my eye lids out so bad that it made me look 10 years older
let me start off by saying i'm a huge fan of fresh-- i use the lotus youth preserve face cream
the smell put me off
put it on my face after the nude rescue oil
i put this on my face
the product just sits on your skin
whitehead like bumps the next morning
it made my sink dirty since it would leave residue from the oil
i am still having to remove my eye makeup before h
i expected to be blown away by this product
i found i had to wash my face again with a different cleanser to feel like my skin has actually been cleaned
you must follow-up with a regular cleansing foam
makes it hard to rub your face of makeup when you have to add water right away
the oil inside turned murky
it got rid of all my make up
smearing oil on a face full of make-up felt really gross
it did get all my make-up off
rub it in to get my make-up off
then add some water
had to wash it off.
it will irritate your skin deep down.
ok this thing is responsible for causing a wrinkle under my left eye
the wrinkle formed bc i was using this face oil all over my face
the right one already had a wrinkle line under it
still left with the feeling that you need to cleanse your face
considering it takes a lot to remove all of your make up
i found that it burned my eyes or even my skin around my eyes
my skin immediately cleared up
thought great its clearing out my skin bringing some blemishes to the surface
afternoon for about 2 days before my face was absolutely covered in acne
it took me about a week to get my skin back to its normal clear
that evening when i tried to remove my makeup with it
it took an insane amount to actually remove my makeup
more makeup came off on those sheets
save your money and face!
plus the color off-sets my face from my neck
when the guy at the store rubbed it on my h
i tried putting setting powder on top
am relegating it to the drawer
i broke out into serious blemishes
well my face has been breaking out, bad.
now my skin has cleared up
bad idea right after i slept with this on my face
even on my neck
third, it completely dried out my skin.
it has taken me an entire year to get rid of my dry skin
where i don't have make up
couldn't get through 2 before i tossed the rest
the smell test go away, but it is unpleasant
seemed to sit on my skin
my skin cleared up
apart from the smell
i can use it around my eyes.
told myself to keep using to get out all the impurities
in the meantime i'm hiding out until my skin clears up
the orange color was also an issue as it got all over my clarisonic
it smells like the soap used at rest areas on the nys thruway
i could have even put up with having to rinse
this particular cleanser literally gave me a burning sensation that lasted for quite a while
need some brightening by mid week to help me look fake awake
it was foaming on my fingertips before i could even put it on my face
once the foaming/bubbling effect went away it just left a thin
i am in love with the rest of the ibuki line
aside it not helping my redness
the consistency felt like it was watered down
my face does end up smoother
so you end up wasting a lot of it
then when flipping bottle back over to set aside it seems to puff out more
as my skin tended to break out
use it on my face
afterwards, my face feels bruised and it’s red.
the bottle is really only filled about 70%
i experimented by stopping use until my skin cleared up
boom i woke up with 2 zits
i used up the whole bottle my dark spots didn't go away
i woke up the next morning with hydrated skin
also with several tiny pimple like bumps on my face which were not there the night before
the bumps went away
i ended up washing it off
went back to my old chanel hydra essence standby.
i ended up throwing the rest of sample away which is too bad
it sits on top of the skin
sits atop the skin way too long
i think it was causing me to break out in major zits
stays that way all day/night until it is washed off
i would use up to 10 drops
when i wear make up
i decided on this eye cream
still have the fine lines
the under eye skin looks the same
if you put on lotion on in the morning like i do
this product will just add shine to your face
it also left a little bit of a white color behind
although the scent goes away
save your $$ and skip this one.
it sits on top of my skin
bring back the old stuff!!!
within a day or two it caused little red bumps all over my face
on the plus side
i felt like it took forever to absorb into my skin
make them water until i wash it off
whenever i wear this moisturizer during the day my skin ends up looking
something about this formula causes it to pill up on my face
it consistently broke my chin
greasy after having it on
you have to use something with an edge to scoop it out so for that reason i'm on the fence
when i rinse my face in the morning
then it was just placing solid chunks on my skin
i still half a jar left.
it separates and starts to almost crumble off.
puffy was never a problem for me before.
hard to pick up on your finger
my eye area looks
my fine lines are still there
the lines under my eyes
while the product did sink in
still have fine lines
it feels like it just lays on top of your skin rather than sink in
all it did was make my eyes puffy
i've had issues with this along with one other eye cream in the past
also made my eyes burn
to freshen up my eyes
unfortunately every morning when i wake up my eyes feel puffy
this would go away with time
what pushed me over the edge
now all of the sudden they are
i apply it before bed
when i wake up in the morning my eyes are so crusty
when i do use it i wake up in the morning
start furiously rubbing my eyes because they're basically crusted shut which i feel like defeats the purpose of the product
balls up under the eye
if you even touch your under eye after applying this it will pill up
put makeup on top of it
it gave me white bumps all over my face
fine lines around my eyes
i feel like i need to clean my face immediately upon waking
if i stop using it for a night the pores on my nose go back to looking the same immediately
about to throw it away
left my face red
it sits on the skin for ages before sinking in
it also seems to flake off whatever sits under it
oh well, back to the drawing board.
of course my hair ends up getting greasy around my face
i saw some spot fading pretty quickly
it does help with the fine lines on my upper lip
which wouldn't bother me if the product rocked
the first night i used this i woke up to tiny bumps all over my face
to top it all off
runs down your face so quickly
this firming oil has made me break out.
mess up my skin
the skin on my cheeks became sensitive after about a week to anything i put on
aside from pretty packaging
the mixing of the products was a complete mess because it was so thick
after no light at the end of the tunnel
it pills up frantically under my powder foundation
letting it sit for 30 minutes before i apply the powder
it rolls up into little balls that stick to my fave
it's taken months for my skin to clear up
i noticed breakouts in the evening after washing my face
it made it slide right off my face by the end of the day
a no go for me i still gave it a 3 star bc it does has sun protection in it
i agree with others saying it balls up under makeup
it balls up on clean skin
it balls up under makeup
because the product rolled up on my skin every time
for ruining my makeup every single time i used you
or even if i ditched the moisturizer/makeup all together
with pressing it into my skin instead of swiping
warming it up on the back of my h
i got this in the sephora sun safety kit
will be giving this one away.
this stuff kept my make-up on from 7am until 7pm.
it balls up on my skin
i ended up throwing it away.
with it being on your face it is all up in your nostrils to stay
for the face only then my makeup pills
i ended up using eye makeup remover on my entire face along with my usual cleanser
the good: on parts of my face this was smooth
the biggest problem for me is that it pilled up around the edges of my face
then it started to pull up on my skin even with just brushing my cheek w/my h
find some way to keep it from peeling off
it pills up as you're applying
came off even if you wear it alone it leaves pieces on your face
by midday it is pilling up
rolling off my face
i can't help feeling a little ripped off
before putting a primer on
it only takes an hour after applying this cream for my face to be drenching in oil
i'll occasionally use this as a primer before i put my foundation on
although it plumps skin on the short run
i tried it under makeup
i put it on my face
i began to rub my checks
the moisturizer is literally coming off my skin.
this caused me to break out horribly
won't slide off as the day goes on
seriously within a couple of hours i looked like a grease slick
it also didn't live up to the title of a 'mattifying' moisturizer
can go through 9 blotting sheets a day
nothing can keep the oil at bay all day
even at night on a clean face with no foundation over it
my make up still shifted
after a day of work at my desk job
this product neither mattifies not moisturizes--back to the drawing board
literally every time i wear this under my foundation
then the thicker product comes out
pill up throughout the day
my pores start showing up again
i now dip the ball in my other eye products
then another eye cream on top
with the price point, that irritated me.
i think my eye bag looks worse
hoping it would be my holy grail eye cream
it made my dark circles
it takes a long time for it to sink in
this just sits on my skin for hourssss
usually my skin soaks it up for the most part within 30 minutes
just looked oily on the rest of my face
i put some on my face
ended up washing it off
to the point where it felt like my make up was melting off
hard to spred on my face
scrape the remaining wash off my face
rinse my face twice to get all the makeup off
when i switched face washes, my skin was fine.
i ended up with small red bumps all over my chin
when i switch back to my lower ph cleanser my acne clears up
finally tested the ph level on this cleanser
for me it's going to end up being another body wash
this left a strange film on my skin
the very first time i used this it just about burnt my eyeballs out of my hear
last step in removing makeup
winds up taking more effort than i want to at the end of the day
2 stars because it does take off face makeup well
it also made my skin break out
my only complaint is that it left a shiny film on my face
my makeup just slides off
my skin is back to its self finally
because it caused me to break out around my chin
this product caused me to break out--badly
along the side of my face
it seemed to just sit on top of my face
my complaint lies in the way it feels after it dries
it also peels off my face if i accidentally touch my face during the day + no hydration whatsoever
have a stock pile for winter
regardless of the fact that i really patted it in with my ring finger as well as give it time to sink in
will just throw out what is left
as a brightening mask it literally did nothing
got break out all over the face
i also see a couple small bumps around the sides of my nose
it breaks my skin out again
s of it very easily get stuck in my hair as it is "peeling" away
it is like a gel mask that you then have to sort of scrape off your face
i basically had to wash my face to get the product off
then add water to peel off
i don't like the hassle of adding water back on
then rolling off the mask
i got some stuck in my hair
this mask does leave my face feeling clean
this says that it will get rid of dark spots
they go away quickly as long as i don't scratch
left it feeling dirty
however-----i have to wash my skin 4x with at least 12 pumps to get 75% of my makeup off
i literally have to wash my face 3x
fine lines still there.
didn't notice a big difference in the dryness of my under eye once morning came when using it overnight
but was fine using under makeup.
after using the whole bottle
the fine lines under my eyes
then disappears which means my make up just cakes up into the fine lines under my eyes
leave it there for a while before finally rubbing it in
have two fine lines under my eyes
have two lines underneath my eyes
pretty sure its from pulling the skin under my eyes everyday/night putting in
i still need to use up the rest of the bottle
pair that up with more breakouts
after about half an hour my skin feels really irritated
i look in the mirror
the glitter that's on my face just ruins everything
i squeezed this into my h
s it it has glitter in it no way am i putting that on my face
it never felt clean after using it
do this in the shower
purchased this on my quest to find a good am/pm face cleanser to clean my pores of the dirt
the mud side had to constantly be fixed which required me to disassemble the entire bottle
tossed about 1/4 of the product because i don't have time to mess with that
will take off all your makeup
the mud, on the other hand, was underwhelming.
this left my skin feeling tight
another for eye makeup
this product leaves my face feeling completely stripped after using every single time
after like 5 minutes it was almost unbearable
since you just wipe it off the cent is there until you wash
while my skin felt moisturizer once i washed my face it felt normal again
with a little powder on top
kind of sits on top
upon putting foundation over it
wearing this product every day
as soon as i stopped wearing it the peeling stopped
i tend to only put this on at night before bed or under my foundation
then go out for the day makeup free bc it makes me look super pale against my all over tan body
i've tried ignoring my appearance
the product begins to ball up if you buff anything on top of it
since starting this i find my chin
when applied it actually leaves a bit of a while cast on your face
the rest of the algenist genius line
it made my face look really white compared to my neck
went back to my other agenist cream with spf 20
it started to peel off
the ingredients are going to break down.
by the end of the day i already had zits forming around my chin area
by the time i washed it off my face was covered in little red bumps
when i put in on my skin it was thick
my face still feels thirsty even right after application
in fact my skin feels tight after i put it on.
almost feels like i have a layer of plastic wrap over my face
forget about even trying to put any makeup or powder on top
every time i just sweat pure white out of my pores within minutes
it would start to flake up after a while
it also seemed to trap sweat
stay away from this one
the fact that it leaves a white cast at first
a few mins after applying i began to notice that it started "melting" above my cupids bow
i put makeup over it
it starts to melt off
i contemplated returning it along with the first aid beauty hydra-firm sleeping cream
i exchanged it for the first aid beauty 5 in 1 face cream spf 30
i think it goes away after absorbed
kept leaving a white film/cast
was really messy along the hair line
even after waiting for it to soak in
then the product pilled up
it kept leaving a white residue on my face
it wouldn't go away even after massaging
it takes arm power to make it disappear
which eventually messed up my skin again
i then had to use a foundation too dark for me to offset the white cast
the back of my h
purchased it right away
i will use this up on my arms
aside from this issue
there were clumps of it all over my face
it was hard to take off
would flake off my face whilr it was on
now $20 is in the trash
my eyes have been watering since i removed the mask
it was okay putting on & it dried quickly.
as it dried the clumps made a mess on my couch as they fell off
get in my eyes
i will have pimples the next morning from this mask
i woke up to two more pimples
within seconds of putting it on my face starting to sting
it burns for the first 2-3 min
even after two back-to-back uses
its near impossible to let it sit on your skin for longer then a minute or two before it starts to drip
realized that it was causing some redness on my face right after i had rinsed it off
then i wash it off then dab my face dry
follow it up with sephora br
then wiped off after massaging into skin as instructed
i wouldn't recommend it to anyone since rinsing it off stripped my face of any moisture to be gained
instructions to simply wipe off when done --
had to back away from that idea
it felt like it cleaned my face
it does take my face makeup off well
barely removes my makeup
one for the eyes
one for the face?
it does remove any face make up
left it feeling tight
that is how my skin is after every face oil
usually only around my eyes
my face turned pink
during that time my skin was bubbling
when i washed it off it just made my skin feel smooth
after using it my skin was tight
unfortunately i'm sticking to nights only
when i put this cream on after applying the treatment
especially around my mouth
i'll probably finish out the rest on my neck.
even with no make up or any moisturizer on top
it flakes like no tomorrow
later when i went to apply my foundation this started to flake off of my skin as i smoothed the foundation on
within minutes it leaves my face feeling tight
needed a pick me up
the mask was so hard to remove
you had to literally scrub it off
my pores were smaller, and my face felt clean.
its just not showing on my skin
it actually made me break out on my nose
the next day i got a whole bunch of small pimples
accidentally picked up this mask instead of the instant detox mask
i am better off using some of my other trusty masks
this one sort of feels like it just sits on top of the skin
i put it on as a leave in mask
you apply, wait 10-15 minutes and rinse off.
could apply just to my nose
have to really work at cleaning it off
it remains on your face for the rest of the day
or till you wash it off
i think it got my skin back in balance.
it started to get that healthy glow back after a week
it lingers on all day
my face felt sticky when i went to bed.
my face was red
woke up with three pimples
looked in the mirror before bed
it reminds me of s drug store lotion that had been sitting on the shelf too long
in the process of washing it off
after i washed it off my face felt the same
this just smelled like straight up perfume.
in removing a lot of make up
my cotton ball had lots of makeup on it.
i could see myself using it on a relaxed morning
it works at taking off makeup
i've applied night cream over the film with no break outs or ill effects
love how it melts into my hands and onto my face.
second cleanser to actually remove the oil
what little eye makeup is left on my face comes right off when i use a q tip or cotton ball to wipe at it after cleansing because the product won't fully cleanse off
i still have about half of the jar left
instructions say keep away from eyes
it caused some break outs
after couple use my skin is peeled off my face
peeled some of my skin off after a few uses
then into a cleansing milk when it comes in contact with water
the scent lingers after you clean your face
you need a separate cleanser for your eyes since instructions say to keep it away from your eyes
massaging it into my face for 30 seconds
then splashing in some water
who is just cleansing their face
there was literally no improvement in my fine lines
it also made my eyes water like crazy for about 15 to 20 minutes after i put it on
it does get the rest of my makeup off when i use it after a cleansing oil
this treatment did sting my face
using a nose strip then this product
my skin never felt clean after using it.
once it sits in your bathroom for a week or two it absorbs moisture
the reviews for this product gave me high hopes that something would finally help clear up my black heads on my nose
'll be switching back to a more gentle cleanser
after using a whole stick
about halfway through the stick the turning function stopped working
stuck my finger in
i'll stick with regular face wash
it cleaned my face well
when i applied pressure the stick started to bend
you end up wasting a lot of product
could wash my face on the plane
ended up with goop all over my face
making it impossible to screw the lid back on
it just left a film like feeling on top of my skin
not for 50 dollars though i can get the same refreshment splashing water on my face
at first it seems like a sort of forest floor frangrance
the smell stuck around for at least an hour.
my face was sticky the entire day.
it felt like i was putting face wash on my face.
a few hours after using this it literally looked like someone dumped grease on my face
i first thought my nose ring was infected because i got mask ingredients stuck in there
one day i kept wondering why my face smelled of latex
the smell freaked me out so much that i had to wipe it off my face
it just sits in my bathroom gathering dust as i don't want to throw it away because it cost over $100
even after putting my moisturizer on
comes to find out that it was my face all along
it firms up my chin area nicely
returned everything except the make up no more foundation
to smell it on my face
did this mask before i went to bed hoping to wake up with brighter skin
instead woke up with a huge
took my makeup off my pores was so clogged
have your face red with a sharp line marking where you didn't apply the mask
when i stopped using it my skin cleared up so
perfect for morning to wake up
thankfully my regular skin care routine had those pimples gone by the next morning
i bit the bullet
the hype around this mask
my face did brighten when i washed it off
i'll go back to my drugstore brand.
then this brightening mask
i like masks where i can see results right away.
after using it for the 3 days in a row i got tiny micro bumps all over my forehead
it makes my face red every time after i use it
my face feels extra clean once the mask is washed off
it polished away the week old built up residue that remains in your pores even after washing your face
i ended up putting on a hydrating mask
after each use just to calm my skin
i couldn't get the blasted grit washed off my face to save my life
it was like trying to wash beach s
my skin clears up
left a film on my face even after washing off
she's making a different face in each picture.
the mask did help to smooth out my skin
as soon as i rinsed it was gone
it goes away after putting it on
i need to cover my face
had to wash it off
this mask made me break out so badly afterwards
after using a fresh rose mask afterwards
then i'll just use my fingers to massage my skin
finally wash the product out
the pores around my nose looked a little smaller for about 3 hours after i washed the mask off
i woke up with even more texture on my face.
during the day it makes my eye shadow look really bad
i keep this aside when i run out of my other creams
after putting it on in the mornings the application would dry my under eyes making my face look like i did not wash my face
within days the skin under my eyes was so dried out i couldn't continue to use it
just sits on top of my skin
i've had that problem with straight up sunscreen before
it still irritated my eyes
i left it like a regular mask
for storage i started freaking out until i remembered i had leftover lush sample pots which work
gross that after an hour of trying to fall asleep not sticking to my pillow
wash it off my face
hydrated face when i woke up
slimy when i woke up
they are also sticky so not very comfortable to sleep in unless you sleep on your back all night
i got the green one.
just buy the sheet masks instead
the first day i woke up with 3 pimples on my chin where i never break out
there's no way to properly seal it once opened
also after following up with my regular morning routine of toning/makeup
which means no mess on my pillow at night
if you picked this up
it gets the job done of removing makeup
the smell i literally try to hold my breath while i wash my face
i end up with raccoon eyes
the water like consistency just shot out
even after i washed it off
makeup remaining on my skin
i would have to take a second step of wiping my face with a cotton pad
dirt still on my face
to make sure my face was fresh
i tried to remove it by washing my face
wanted a fast wipe clean
i recommend this for the lighter makeup wearing girls out there
no trace left behind without the heavy scrubbing best seek another option
even after a lot of massaging the makeup loose
i would like to add all those clogged pores had went away when i began using my clarisonic
came back using this face wash
the clarisonic my nose is back to looking like a strawberry
i keep this in the shower now for when i need a quick face wash
it removed about 80% of my makeup
i still needed to follow up with another cleanser
when i tried it, it felt light weight.
sits on top of your skin forever
every 10 minutes i had to rub it into my skin again
again until i believe i just rubbed it completely off my skin
my eyes just gotten more puffy than before when i woke up each morning
i woke up with puffy eyes
fell in love with the bio correcting eye creme after a deluxe sample was the first thing to clear the dark circles under my eyes in years
see it right up there on the front of the ingredients list
the estee night repair eye serum in miles ahead of this product
when i finished applying this to my face it left my skin so squeaky
am walking away with a neutral opinion
re-wash my face twice to get rid of the scent
it made my eyes constantly water.
it was too thick for me good for a night time routine
all because it stopped my skin from cracking
it sits on top of my skin
back to the drawing board.
let me start off by saying i miss the old dramatically different moisturizer
that's coming from a person who is heavy h
this ended up being to thick for me
if you wipe a tissue on your skin while having had applied this
also it just sat on my skin and didnt absorb.
will just sit on the surface
or any woman that is on the struggle bus to not sleeping a lot/heriditary under eye problems
seems to smooth up complexion around the face
it completely took them away
this burned my skin after one use
it took weeks to heal
can see 4 white/red bumps all in a row
i just hope these bumps heal
my under eye wrinkles are very close to my waterline
it made me look like a complete grease bomb
looked up the ingredients online
break my face out like crazy
it cleared up immediately
i also tried adding it into my foundation to make my skin look more dewy
i think i broke out mixing two formulas together
after like 5min, her redness went down by a lot!
she kept putting more on loll.
how could i return it half empty ?
after going through a whole jar
within two hours of wearing it under my makeup i looked really greasy
i could literally wipe my h
it was covered in makeup
my fingers would literally
pulling them away resulted in that "sticky sound" effect
even after putting a primer on
i walked in to sephora hooked on a different moisturizer thinking it would help resolve texture on my skin
after putting it on
if new pimples keep popping up like they have been then i'll consider this a complete waste of money
the other almost feels greasy going on
the problem i had is that it greased up on my skin after a few hours
octinoxate breaks down above zone
this eye cream stings my eyes beyond belief i am going to try to return it to sephora
i applied this product at night before bed because it bled so much into my eyes that i couldn't wear it during the day
going back to my old eye cream!
it has literally done nothing for my eyes/ under-eye bags
skin bumps that i had throw it away :
get it prepped for foundation
the jar is almost empty
didn't brighten me up.
i don't see any changes after the container is almost empty
halfway done with my jar
it did not end up in the skin care graveyard at the back of the cabinet
s stayed sticky for hours after applying this stuff
still have the whole jar sitting in my washroom
goes on smooth onto your face
stayed sticky all day
i like how my skin feels after i rinse it off in the am
the stinging has gone away
this stuff set my face on fire
my face got clean, and that was about it.
it seemed to sit on the face
the more i noticed that it tingled/burned after i put it on
uncomfortable when it was on my face that i had to go re-wash my face
later on in the night i realized some small red bumps on my skin
the only time i get acne is when my skin reacts badly to a product
so bad that my face cringed as i put it on.
it just sits on top of my skin
now i feel stuck using it
tight like i need to add another night moisturizer over it
gave this product three stars because it stays sticky under the eye
around the eye all day long
it made the makeup around my eyes look super patchy
then have to rub off all your makeup
it stung my eye
it crumbled off when i rubbed it in
it didn't work for putting concealer on over because it crumbled off
i used it one day when i had fresh cleansed kin
do my routine make up on top
i looked like i had theatrical make up under my eyes to purposely age me
can leave residue around my eyes
if you get it too close to your eyelashes or lower eyelid
i wear it at night because when you wear makeup on top of it it starts to flake
when i apply it around my eyes
i wake up with dark circles
it felt like a good eye balm until i started noticing the skin around my eyes changing
this *flakes like crazy* under makeup
or help my dark circles at all
then this immortelle eye balm brought them back
some lines under my eyes
wear make-up for up to 12 hours
back to its sister until i find something better without the hefty price tag
this cream made my face break out
had to dump a lot of the jar
immortelle precious cream was off shelves for awhile
the contents of the jar are about down to half
both nights my hair around my face was oily when i woke up
my face was breaking out around the chin area
the skin on my face overall just dried out
tonight this left me broken out on my cheeks
instead i saw red patches on my face
whoever came up with this formula probably has some sort of resentment toward humanity
when i went to unscrew the cap
it takes forever to wash off
my skin was back to normal
including the pink one
make up off of my skin
made me break out all over.
i don't like the stripped feeling it leaves behind
it cleared my skin up very quickly after i started using it
following that it caused lots of peeling
it washes out better in the shower
i just try to keep it away from my eyes now
almost a squeaky clean finish after one use
it gets rid of all the make up
feel like i put oil mixed with honey on my face
even after an hour it is still sticky on my face.
it also had build up of dried up serum near
now i need to recover with all these red spots on my face
i resort to outing it out into my palm.
a cap does not shut tightly once opened
the texture of my skin after just one week
have good skin from staying out of sun
it would pill up
soon after my cheeks were red
i'll keep using it until my new eye cream comes in
i like the idea of the roller ball
i even put it in freezer
some of my eye masks did a better job cooling the skin around my eye area without even have to sit in the fridge at all
at the end of the day, it ruined my foundation.
itchy after the first 2 steps
pat it on my face to prevent over usage
it stings a bit when i put it on after scrubbing
a rip off for the price to be honest.
aside for the occasional breakout my skin is clear
it seems to be missing the tube inside the bottle that should connect to the dispenser
once you pull the top off of the bottle
i tried everything-tipping it over
i finally used a q-tip to scrape the cream into the center of the bottle
i dreaded applying it every day
it is definitely balling up
leaving little chunks all over my face
clogged my pores and broke me out pretty bad.
unlike the rest of the ceramidin line
the sephora rep had told me it would help improve my sun damage
i do like the initial feeling when you rub it in
then the product balls up
ill pass on this
i washed off immediately
woke up to no less than a dozen zits today
feels like i have a residue feeling left over
when i have makeup on
it just isn't cutting it for my routine purposes
dragged on my face while using the foreo
instantly started to get red
i like the way the container looks on my shelf
after three tries, i am pitching it in the trash.
once you wash it off
a couple of them are definite staples in my bathroom
i wiped it off immediately because it was so uncomfortable
come off in little lumps
also made my foundation look like cement when underneath
it immediately starts coming off of my skin in little flakes
decided to use it one morning as the moisturizer underneath my foundation
this rise 'n shine daily moisturiser is awful.
each time i get the same result: sticky
i even tried it on my arms
legs in order to use it up
it was like i had a layer of dry glue that started to pill as soon as i attempted to put on my base
this product balls up on the skin
this product sort of rolls up
i ended up scrubbing it off my face because it felt so weird
i tried using it before putting my make up on
it doesnt sink into the skin
it didn't absorb into my skin at all after a couple of hours
once it dries it balls up if you happen to smooth your finger over your face
how easily it sunk into my skin
seen people say that this product "balled up"
almost as if i washed my face with toilet paper
this balled up into little bits
clump must not have touched their face at all after applying it
it balled up when i applied makeup which belies its name rise 'n shine
it rolls up into little balls
falls off your face when you try to apply makeup over it
sadly this goes in the no pile.
when i try 2 "work" it into my skin
it rolls up on my skin.
i actually washed it off pretty quickly in favor of putting on another moisturizer
once i started my makeup it just balled up
it seems like every time i brush my face
when i put it on, it balled up too.
just as i was running out of my perricone point perk moisturizer
noticed that my foundation balls up
it seemed like a mask or face wash at first application
then make you look like your skin is peeling off
i started using it for my fine lines around my eyes
i couldn't apply anything on top of it as it made everything pill up
when i finally applied my primer
it lays on top and during the day it balls off.
have to keep rubbing until it all soaks up
there are bunch of flakes coming out
it remained white as if i put soap directly on my skin
plus it caused my makeup to ball up into little weird flakes
do zero to my face
started getting red itchy bumps on the side of my face where i put most of the product since that's where my dark spots were
ever since i stopped using it the spots have been slowly going away
i ended up using it as a body soap
it seems to be clearing up
will use it up as a body soap
why do you take away my joy of taking a bath?
decided i'd sniff the bar to see how it smelled
then i noticed when it would heal a zit
two or three more big ones would pop up in its place
on the plus side
using it up on my neck and chest.
not purging broke me out either
it will leave a blue residue on my face
some of them break me out
i tried everything with this from only putting it on itself to putting it on top of my moisturizer
my face is back to normal
love almost every smell out there
this time the color was way off
my complexion cleared up
i woke up to new pimples in unusual spots.
then it seemed like my pores started to clog
other then that i got no "glow" effect
gemstones settle at bottom even when you stir
had to wash it off immediately to not throw up
this one literally hurt
this face mask is a rip off
this cream seemed to sit on top of my skin
i get a minimum of 7 hours of sleep
during that time my under eye area kept getting dryer
then it got itchy.
l need an eye cream that helps depuff the bags under my eyes
my skin is just falling off
i've started to alternate using this with an eve lom eye product to address my fatigued eyes
does nothing for fine lines and darkness.
didn't brighten up the eye area at all.
this eye cream did nothing for my dark circles or eye zone
turn red like no other
while i like the day cream
noticed a cooling/soothing feeling immediately on my arm when i put it on
after falling deeply in love with their fresh face cleanser
the dropper wouldn't fill up
turned the bottle upside down
half the bottle emptied all over my h
it had some stuck to the sides
you then take a breath
it still felt like my face was sticking to the pillow
also leaves a film on my face
it lingers all day
it also turned my hands orange.
my face was orange
even skin tone all takes place
now it in garbage bin.
it left behind a horrible smell on my h
that smell lingered all day too
glowy after just two use
i broke out with white heads around my jaw line
after cutting everything out
it started to sting up application
it made my face break out bad
literally feels like shaving cream on your face.
it prevented my makeup from settling in
it took two washes to get it all off
still use it in the morning under bb cream with sun protection
my face felt more oily during the days when i was using it
feels like i'm just putting on foam
it comes out just like shaving cream
according to the directions you rub it onto your dry face
still felt dirty after washing my face with this product
this face wash is great for getting your face clean
makes it hard to breathe while washing my face
a lot of foam comes out at a time
my dark spot is still not fading.
when using it i found myself missing my classic face cleansers
this product made me break out so bad it took weeks of using a different cleanser to put a dent into getting my skin back to normal
after washing my face with this
even after massaging this into my skin for 30 seconds
after using a cleaning oil this takes everything off
expect your face to be clean
this made me all red
keep in mind that this is a mild
i ended up having to use my purity cleanser after it to get my make up off
does a poor job at taking make up off which leads me to believe it doesn't get surface dirt off either with how little make up i was wearing that day
it feels like putting shaving cream on your face
it disappears on your face
after washing it off i'll follow it with a sheet mask
notice a bit of a difference from when i just use the sheet mask
it barely feels like it cleans or had an impact on the skin
the mouse disappears within 15 seconds of being on your skin
the fun smoothing of it onto my face
my skin felt fine after using
it felt cooling after putting it on.
when i woke up, i was covered in pimples.
just washed it off.
i got the regular size along with the nighttime moisturizer
i basically have started to use eye creams just to prevent all that
every time i applied eye makeup i would notice how the corners of my eyes had these tight dry-skin "pull lines" which hadn't been there before when i was using no eye cream
breaks my skin out
especially as my skin feels dried out again immediately after washing it off
under my eyes look worse after using for 1 week
i still have my lines under my eyes
sephora is far away from my house
i started by testing it out on a family of dark-spots on my chin for 2 weeks
used it on my face mainly on my jaw down to my neck
have your spots removed that way
they clear up right away
whole bottle down, no change.
then that defiant little age spot on my cheek was baaaaack
adding a good five minutes to my face care routine
i protect my skin during the day
am rarely outside in the sun
when i left it in my product cabinet for some weeks a circle white ball developed inside the bottle
my dark spots from acne or spots i got from the sun aren't going away at all
put it on after showering
would irritate my eyes hours after application
keep waiting for some of the dark spots to lighten
saw no difference in my sun spots
it lightened the rest of my face
my blackspots have not gone away on my face
my dark spots are still there
i just wanted to lighten up my acne scars
just keep it in mind
it might go away after 10-15 minutes
it just felt like glue when you first put it on
the bottle is empty now
i barely had any sun damage until last summer
this product made my entire face very red when i put it on
still i'm powering through on the hopes of even skin in 2016
neither were cleared using this wash.
my skin has started to clear on it's own
they ultimately left my skin irritated
now use it on my chest
i actually woke up with swollen eyes today because of it
my entire face was red
i came along this cleanser through the skin care i
breaking down my face makeup
then i splashed water on my face.
first i noticed that my eyes were all blurry like the oil somehow got into my eyes
to make sure it picked up all the makeup i wiped a cotton pad
i could even see residue from left over foundation on my skin
pros: cleans off make up easily.
it takes a good 3-4 pumps to get enough oil on my face to break through the makeup
on a day to day basis i don't wear heavy or a full face of makeup just cc cream
to also wash my face with in between yoga
i find i need to at least splash water on my face after to relieve it
the next morning all of the little bumps on the side of my face were gone
f i was in need of a "deeper" clean to get down to the pores
made them shed from the intensity of this cleanser
i am switching back to my other face wash
my skin just flared up bright red
i started off with the other cleanser
it clears up my occasional breakouts
takes off all my make up
it dries my face out so much that my face is literally stiff after i use it
i try to stay as clean as i can with my h
using up a little over half the bottle
it took too long for me to get the moisture back in my skin
its not that i'm leaving it slightly open
washed away my makeup easily
has cleared up some problems
literally every day i have new pimple
this made me break out into big
i started to get blemishes
as soon as i washed it off
i got to try this cleanser in 3-step set.
it also made my makeup pill up in little balls that got all over my hair/clothes
as it started drying it just rolled up into little balls on my face
see if it helps my skin at all overnight
will roll up in balls on your face all through the day
am even rounding up in my assessment
the product will just peel off
the pimple came back a lot sooner this time
bottom line: save your money
looking back on the description after using it
pulling at my skin
i feel like i need to wash my face again with the slip cleanser
like residue is left over on my face
i still had to use a makeup wipe to remove my foundation
it can be left on for 20-30min as a mask
every time i used it i would break out with small little pimples on my chin
i immediately wiped followed up with my kate somerville toner to get all of the residue of this off my face
got this in the "sleep" box.
first let me say i double cleanse
i got this in the sephora sleep kit
it took off my eye makeup pretty easily
mine seemed to have gritty bits in it
goes on smooth on your face
then immediately wipe it off afterward
after letting this sit on my face
place this over my face
i would then massage the cloth over my face
wipe this product off
kick start treating my skin at the cleansing stage
it broke me out in red bumps that look almost like insect bites under my eyes
the area under my eyes was broken out
it pills on my face like crazy!
i touched my face about 20 mins after application
it came off in little clumps
it kept pilling every time
i like to throw this on when i'm in a rush
made my skin break out
i've ended up having to wash my face
it started to pill all over my face
my makeup sits so well on top of it
got my skin cleared up
i looked up the ingredients
my big issue is the residue it leaves behind on my chest
i found myself following up with a cleansing water to get the residue feeling off my face
got most of my makeup off
tested this on the back of my h
it also left a lot of my make-up on.
wash again with a regular cleanser afterwards
had to get another separate cleanser.
i feel ripped off because i could not get all the product out of the tube
shut "mechanism" just shifted back
it was still too sticky for me to leave on after using my nuface
it just sits on top of the skin
i still needed to use another product to wipe away my mascara
let work for a minute or two before rinsing
it washed off all my make up
because sleeping with a mask on was easy
unfortunately, i wasn't blown away.
